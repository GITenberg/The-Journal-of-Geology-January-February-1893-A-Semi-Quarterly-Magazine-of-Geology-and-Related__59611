<h2><a name="PRE-CAMBRIAN_ROCKS" id="PRE-CAMBRIAN_ROCKS">ON THE PRE-CAMBRIAN ROCKS OF
THE BRITISH ISLES.</a></h2>


<p>During the last twenty years much has been written about
the "pre-Cambrian" rocks of the British Isles. Unfortunately
when attention began to be sedulously given to the study of
these ancient formations, the problems of metamorphism were
still a hundred fold more obscure than they have since become;
the aid of the microscope had not been seriously and systematically
adopted for the investigation of the crystalline schists,
and geologists generally were still under the belief that the
broad structure of these schists could be treated like those of
the sedimentary rocks, and be determined by rapid traverses of
the ground. We have now painfully discovered that these older
methods of observation were extremely crude, and that the work
performed in accordance with them is now of little interest or
value save as a historical warning to future generations of geologists.
Geological literature has meanwhile been burdened with
numerous contributions which remain as a permanent incubus on
our library shelves.</p>

<p>It may serve a useful purpose at the present time in possibly
aiding those who are engaged in the study of the oldest rocks
of North America, if I place before them, as briefly as possible,
the main facts which in my opinion have now been satisfactorily
proved regarding the corresponding rocks of Britain, and if I
indicate at the same time some of the more probable inferences
in those cases where the facts, at present known, do not warrant
a definite conclusion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">« 2 »</a></span></p>

<p>It is obvious that in any effort to establish that a group of
rocks is older than the very base of the sedimentary fossiliferous
formations, we must somewhere find that group emerging from
under the bottom of these formations. Until lithological characters
are ascertained to be so distinctive and constant as to be
comparable to fossil evidence for purposes of stratigraphical
identification, we should not assume that detached areas of older
rocks rising amid Palæozoic, Secondary or Tertiary formations
are pre-Cambrian. We should, if possible, begin at the bottom
of the Palæozoic systems and work backward, tracing each
successive system or group as these rise from under each other,
until we arrive at what appears to be the oldest traceable within
the region of observation. It is clear that in the present
state of knowledge we have no satisfactory means of identifying
such successive systems in widely separated countries. All
that can be attempted in the meantime is to ascertain the special
types in each region, and to point out their general resemblances
or contrasts to those of other regions. It is better to avoid confusion
by refraining from applying the stratigraphical names
adopted for the oldest rocks of one region to those of another
geographically remote, though we may hope that eventually it
may be possible to work out the equivalence of these local
names.</p>

<p>In the British Isles, by much the most important region for
the study of the oldest rocks is to be found in the north-west
Highlands of Scotland. The very basement strata of the Cambrian
system are there traceable for a distance of more than 100
miles, reposing with a strong unconformability upon all rocks of
older date. They consist of dolomitic shales with <i>Olenellus</i>,
resting upon a thick group of quartzites, full of annelid tubes.
One of the most remarkable features of these ancient strata is
the persistence of their component bands or zones which, though
sometimes only a few feet thick, can be traced throughout the
whole tract of country just referred to. For the study of the
pre-Cambrian rocks this is an important point, for we can be
quite certain that even where fossil evidence locally fails, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">« 3 »</a></span>
same basement members of the Cambrian system are persistent
and lie directly upon the pre-Cambrian series.</p>

<p><i>Lewisian Gneiss.</i> Ever since the researches of Murchison and
Nicol in the north-west of Scotland, it has been known that two
distinct systems of rock underlie the quartzites to which I have
just alluded. Murchison regarded the upper of these as of
Cambrian age, while he assigned the unconformable quartzites
and limestones above it to the Lower Silurian period. But the
recent discovery of the <i>Olenellus</i> zone intercalated conformably
between the quartzites and the overlying limestones may be
regarded as proving that all the rocks which underlie the quartzites
and are separated from them by a strong unconformability
must be pre-Cambrian. It is thus established beyond any
reasonable doubt that two great pre-Cambrian systems of rock
exist in the north-west of Scotland.</p>

<p>These two systems differ so entirely from each other that
their respective areas can be defined with minute accuracy. The
uppermost consists chiefly of dull reddish sandstones with conglomerates,
and especially towards their base in Rosshire, some
bands of dark grey shale, the whole having a thickness of at
least 8,000 or 10,000 feet, though as both the base and the top
of the series are marked by strong unconformabilities, the whole
original thickness of deposits is nowhere seen. As these rocks
are well developed around Loch Torridon, they were named by
Nicol the Torridon Sandstone&mdash;a designation which has more
recently been shortened into "Torridonian." The lower system
is mainly composed of various foliated rocks which may be
embraced under the general term "gneiss." These masses present
the usual characters of the so-called "fundamental
complex", "Urgebirge," or "Archæan Series" of other countries.
The contrast between the thoroughly crystalline, gnarled, ancient-looking
gneisses below, and the overlying, nearly horizontal
Torridonian conglomerates, sandstones, and shales, which are
largely made out of their debris, is so striking that every observer
feels persuaded that in any logical system of classification
they can not be both placed in the same division of the geological
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">« 4 »</a></span>
record. They are certainly both pre-Cambrian, but they
must belong to widely separated eras, and must have been produced
by entirely different processes. If it is proposed to regard
the gneisses as "Archæan," we must refuse to include the Torridonian
strata in the same section of pre-Cambrian time. But so
much uncertainty exists as to the application of this term Archæan,
examples are so multiplying wherein what was supposed to be
the oldest and truly Archæan rock is found to be intrusive in
rocks that were taken to be of much younger date, and there are
such slender grounds for correlating the so-called Archæan
rocks of one country with those of another, that I prefer for the
present, at least, not to use the term at all. Let me very briefly
state some of the main characteristics of the two sharply contrasted
rock-systems of the north-west of Scotland.</p>

<p>The oldest gneiss of that region was originally called "Lewisian"
by Murchison, from its large development in the Island of
Lewis, and I think it would be, for the present at least, an advantage
to retain this geographical appellation. At first this
"fundamental gneiss" was thought to be a comparatively simple
formation, and the general impression probably was that it should
be regarded as a metamorphic mass, produced mainly from the
alterations of very ancient stratified rocks. Its foliation-planes
were believed to be those of original deposit which by terrestrial
disturbance had been thrown into numerous plications and corrugated
puckerings. But a detailed study of this primeval rock
has revealed in it a far more complicated structure. The supposed
bedding-planes have been ascertained to have nothing to
do with sedimentary stratification, and the gneiss has been
resolved into a complex series of eruptive rocks, varying from a
highly basic to an acid type, and manifestly belonging to different
times of extrusion. With the exception of one district, to
which I shall immediately refer, no part of the whole region yet
examined has revealed to the rigid scrutiny of my colleagues of
the Geological Survey, any trace of rocks which can be
regarded as probably of other than igneous origin. It is true
that our researches have been hitherto confined to the mainland
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">« 5 »</a></span>
of Scotland, the large area of the Outer Hebrides, which consists
of similar gneisses, remaining to be explored. It is
therefore possible that indisputable evidence of an ancient sedimentary
series through which the gneiss was originally protruded,
may yet be discovered in the unexplored islands. But taking
the gneiss as at present known in Sutherland and Rosshire,
we find it to be generally coarse in texture, rudely foliated, and
passing sometimes into massive types in which foliation is either
faintly developed or entirely absent. Much of this gneiss is
considerably more basic than the more typical rocks to
which the term gneiss was formerly restricted. It consists of
plagioclase felspar with pyroxene, hornblende, and magnetite,
sometimes with blue opalescent quartz, and sometimes with black
mica. These predominant minerals are segregated in different
proportions in the different bands, some bands consisting mainly
of pyroxene or hornblende, with little or no plagioclase, others
chiefly of plagioclase, with small quantities of the ferro-magnesian
minerals and quartz, others of plagioclase and quartz, others
of magnetite. This separation of mineral constituents can hardly
be attributed to mere mechanical deformation. It rather resembles
the segregation layers which may be studied in intrusive sills
and other deep-seated masses of eruptive material, and which
are obviously due to a process of separation that went on while
the igneous magma was still in a liquid or viscous condition.
At the same time it is manifest that extensive dynamical changes
have affected the rocks since the appearance of this original
banded structure.</p>

<p>There is further evidence that beside the original eruptive
masses, which for want of any means of discriminating their relative
dates of protrusion must in the meantime be regarded as
belonging to one eruptive period, other portions of igneous
material have been subsequently and at successive epochs, after
the first mechanical deformations, injected into the body of the
original gneiss. These consist of dykes of basalt and dolerite,
followed by still more basic peridotites and picrites, and lastly by
emanations from a distinctly acid magma in the form of granites.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">« 6 »</a></span>
The oldest or doleritic dykes form a wonderful feature in the
gneiss, from their abundance, persistence and uniformity of trend
in a west-northwest direction. They have no parallel in British
Geology until we reach the crowded dykes of older Tertiary
time.</p>

<p>Throughout this remarkable complex of eruptive material,
though its different portions present many features that may be
compared with those of intrusive bosses and sheets belonging to
later geological periods, there is no trace of any superficial
volcanic manifestation. No tuffs or agglomerates or slaggy
lavas have been detected, such as might serve to indicate the
ejection of volcanic materials to the surface. All the phenomena
of the Lewisian gneiss point to the consolidation of successively
protruded portions of eruptive material at some depth within the
crust.</p>

<p>Nevertheless it may yet be possible to show that these deep
seated masses have been injected into rocks of older date and
of sedimentary origin, and that they have communicated with
the surface in true volcanic eruptions. I have already alluded
to one limited area where various rocks exist, distinctly different
from the prevalent types in the Lewisian gneiss. In the area
which is traversed by the long valley of Loch Maree in western
Rosshire, there occur clay-slates, fine mica schists, graphitic
schists, and saccharoid limestones. These rocks remind us of
some of the prevalent members of a series of metamorphosed
sediments. The minerals enclosed in the marbles are just such
as might be expected in the metamorphic aureole of a granite
boss, piercing limestone. But the relations of this group of rocks
to the ordinary gneiss of the region are not quite so clear as
could be desired, though they seem to point to these rocks
being surrounded by and enclosed within the gneiss.</p>

<p>The detailed field-work of the officers of the Geological Survey
has made known the remarkable amount of mechanical
deformation which the various rock-masses composing the
Lewisian gneiss have undergone. These rocks have been compressed,
crushed, and drawn out, until what were originally massive
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">« 7 »</a></span>
crystalline protrusions have been converted into perfect
schists. The dykes of dolerite have been transformed into hornblende-schists
and the granitic pegmatites have been reduced to
a kind of powder which has been rolled out so as to simulate the
flow-structure of a lava. There is evidence that most, if not all,
of this dynamical change was effected long before the deposition
of the Torridonian series, for the latter rests in nearly horizontal
sheets, with a strong unconformability upon the crushed and
sheared gneiss.</p>

<p><i>Torridon Sandstone.</i> This group of rocks covers only a limited
area in the north-west of Scotland, but it must once have spread
over a far more extensive region. It reaches a thickness, as I
have said, of 8,000 or 10,000 feet, and consists almost wholly of
dull, purplish-red sandstones, often pebbly, and bands of conglomerate.
Dark grey shales, already alluded to as occurring
towards the base of the series, are repeated also in the highest
visible portion, and have yielded tracks of what seem to have
been annelids and casts of nail-like bodies which may have been
organic. I have said that the Torridonian deposits which were
classed by Murchison as Cambrian, have been proved by the discovery
of the <i>Olenellus</i> zone in an unconformable position above
them, to be of pre-Cambrian age. Except along the line of disturbance
to which I shall immediately refer, these strata are quite
unaltered. Indeed, in general aspect they look as young as the
old red sandstones with which Hugh Miller identified them. It
is at first hard to believe that such flat undisturbed sandstones
are of higher antiquity than the very oldest Palæozoic strata
which are so generally plicated and cleaved.</p>

<p>The interval of time between the deposition of the Torridon
Sandstone and of the overlying Cambrian formations must have
been of enormous duration, for the unconformability is so violent
that the lowest Cambrian strata, not only transgressively
overspread all the Torridonian horizons, but even lie here and
there directly on the old gneiss, the whole of the intervening thick
mass of sandstone having been there removed by previous denudation.
At Durness, in the north of Sutherland, about 2000 feet of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">« 8 »</a></span>
Cambrian (possibly in part Lower Silurian) strata can be
traced, the lower portion consisting of quartzites, the central
and upper parts of various limestones, sometimes abundantly
fossiliferous. Nowhere else in the north of Scotland can so
thick a mass of early Palæozoic rocks be seen. Elsewhere the
limestones have been in large measure replaced by a complex
group of schistose rocks which rest upon the Cambrian strata,
and like them dip, generally at gentle angles, towards the east.
It was the opinion of Murchison, and was commonly admitted
by geologists, that these overlying schists represented a thick
group of sediments, which, originally deposited continuously
after the limestones, had been subsequently altered into their
present condition by regional metamorphism. They were variously
named the "Eastern schists," the "younger gneiss," the
"gneissose and quartzose flagstones." Nicol, who at first
shared the general opinion regarding them, afterwards maintained
that they did not belong to a later formation than the
limestones, but were really only the old gneiss, brought up again
from beneath by enormous dislocations and over-thrusts. We
now know from the labors of Professor Lapworth and the officers
of the Geological Survey, that Murchison and Nicol had each
seized on an essential part of the problem, but that both of
them had missed the true solution. Murchison was in error in
regarding his younger gneiss as a continuous sequence of
altered sedimentary rocks conformably resting on the Cambrian
(or to use his terminology, Lower-Silurian) formations. But
he sagaciously observed the coincidence of dip and strike
between the schists and sedimentary rocks below them and
inferred that this coincidence, traceable for many leagues,
proved that the metamorphism which had given these schists
their structure must have taken place after the deposition of the
Durness limestones. Nicol, on the other hand, with great insight
recognized that there was no continuous sequence above those
limestones, but that masses of the old gneiss had been thrust
over them by gigantic faults. But he failed to see that no mere
faults would account for the coincidence between the structural
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">« 9 »</a></span>
lines just referred to in the Cambrian strata, and in the overlying
schists, and that the general tectonic structures and lithological
characters of the eastern schists differed in many respects from
those of the Lewisian gneiss.</p>

<p>The problems in tectonic geology presented by the complicated
structures of the northwest of Scotland have been
ably worked out by the officers of the Geological Survey, to
whose report in the <i>Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society</i>
for 1888, I would refer for full details. It has been shown
that, besides stupendous dislocations and horizontal displacements,
the rocks have been cut into innumerable slices which
have been driven over each other from the eastward, while at
the same time there has been such a general shearing of the
whole region that for many hundreds of square miles the
original rock-structures have been entirely effaced, and have
been replaced by new divisional planes, which, when they
approach the underlying Cambrian strata, are roughly parallel
with the bedding planes of these strata.</p>

<p>In this region, therefore, we have striking proofs of a stupendous
post-Cambrian regional metamorphism. But there is still
much uncertainty regarding the geological age of the rocks
which have been affected by it. There can be no doubt that
large masses of the old gneiss, torn up from below, have been
thrust bodily westward for many miles, and are now seen with
their dykes and pegmatites resting on the Durness limestones and
quartzites. It is equally certain that in other districts huge
slices of the Torridon sandstones have been similarly treated.
But where all trace of original structure has disappeared, we
have, as yet, no means of definitely determining from what formation
the present eastern schists have been produced. The
ordinary gneissose and quartzose flagstones do not appear to me
to be such rocks as could ever be manufactured by any chemical
or mechanical process out of the average type of Lewisian
gneiss. I have long held the belief that they were originally
sediments, but whether they represent altered Torridon Sandstone,
or some clastic formations which may have followed the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">« 10 »</a></span>
Durness limestones, but which have been everywhere and
entirely metamorphosed, remains for future discovery. For my
present purpose, it is sufficient to observe that, in the meantime,
as we can not be sure of the origin of most of the rocks, which,
between the West Coast and the line of the Great Glen, have
been subjected to a gigantic post-Cambrian regional metamorphism,
it seems safest to exclude them from an enumeration of
the pre-Cambrian rocks of Britain.</p>

<p><i>Dalradian.</i> East of the line of Great Glen, which cuts the
Scottish Highlands in two, another group of crystalline schistose
rocks is largely developed. It consists mainly of what were
undoubtedly originally sedimentary deposits, though they are
now found in the form of quartzites, phyllites, graphitic schists,
mica-schists, marbles, and various other foliated masses. With
them are associated numerous eruptive rocks, both acid and
basic, sometimes still massive and easily recognizable as intrusive,
sometimes more or less distinctly foliated and passing into
different gneisses, hornblende-schists, chloritic-schists, etc.
Though it is not always possible in such a series of metamorphic
rocks to be certain of any real chronological order of succession,
those of the Highland tracts have now been mapped in detail over
so wide an area, that we are probably justified in believing that
a definite sequence can be established among them. These
masses must be many thousand feet thick. Their succession
and association of materials are so unlike those of any of the
known older Palæozoic rocks of Britain, that they can hardly be
the metamorphosed equivalents of any strata which can be
recognized in an unaltered condition in these islands. Some
traces of annelid casts have been found in the quartzites, but
otherwise the whole series has remained entirely barren of
organic remains.</p>

<p>What then is the age of this important series? I must confess
that in the meantime I can give no satisfactory answer to
this question. I have proposed, for the sake of distinction and
convenient reference, to call these rocks "Dalradian." Murchison
supposed them to be a continuation of his Durness quartzites,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">« 11 »</a></span>
limestones, and "younger gneiss." His belief may still prove
to be in some measure well founded. But at present we have
no means of deciding whether the quartzites and limestones of
the Central Highlands are the more altered equivalents of the
undoubtedly Cambrian strata of the north-west. It is possible
that in the vast mass of metamorphosed rocks constituting the
wide stretch of country from the northern headlands of Aberdeen
to the south-western promontories of Argyllshire, there
may be portions of the old Lewisian gneiss, tracts of highly
altered Torridon sandstone, belts of true counterparts of the
Cambrian quartzites and limestones of Durness, and, what should
not be forgotten, considerable portions of some later sedimentary
series which may have followed these limestones, but which, by
the great dislocations already referred to, have disappeared from
the north-west of Scotland. We are gradually learning more of
these rocks, as the detailed mapping of them by the Geological
Survey advances, and when the ground on either side of the
Great Glen is surveyed, it may be possible to speak with more
certainty regarding their true geological relations.</p>

<p>A glance at a geological map of the British Isles will show
that the metamorphic rocks of the south-western Highlands of
Scotland are prolonged into the north of Ireland, where they
spread over a region many hundred square miles in extent.
They retain there the same general character and present the
same difficult problems as to their true stratigraphical relations.
Quite recently, however, a new light seems to have arisen upon
these Irish rocks. My colleagues on the Irish Branch of the
Geological Survey have detected several detached areas of
coarse gneisses, which in many respects resemble parts of the
Lewisian gneiss of north-west Scotland. In some cases these
areas lie amidst or close to "Dalradian" rocks, but with that
obstinacy, which so tries the patience of the field-geologist, they
have persistently refused to disclose their true original position
with regard to these. Some fault, thrust-plane, tract of boulder-clay
or stretch of bog is sure to intervene along the very junction-line
where the desired sections might have been looked for.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">« 12 »</a></span>
There can be little doubt that a strong unconformability exists
between them. A close examination of the ridge of old gneiss
in Tyrone and Fermanagh showed me that though the actual
basement-beds of this Dalradian series could not be seen resting
on the coarse gneiss, the lithological character, and tectonic
arrangement of this series are only explicable on the supposition
of a complete discordance between it and the gneiss. As these
two groups of rock have never been found in close proximity in
Scotland, and as the determination of the true age of the
Dalradian series is a question of such great stratigraphical
importance in the general mapping of the United Kingdom, I
requested Mr. A. McHenry, of the Geological Survey of Ireland,
to continue the tracing of the mutual boundaries of the old
gneiss of the Ox Mountains and the Dalradian series in County
Mayo. He informs me that he has found in that series a conglomerate
full of blocks of the old gneiss, and resting in one
locality apparently unconformably upon it. If this observation
is confirmed it will finally set at rest the relative position of the
coarse massive gneiss and some portion, at least, of the
Dalradian series. Of course there is no absolute proof that the
coarse gneisses of Ireland are really the equivalents of the
Lewisian masses which they so closely resemble. But there is
a strong presumption in favor of their identity.</p>

<p>In England and Wales many detached areas of rock have
been claimed as pre-Cambrian, and successive formations have
been classified among them. I have already dealt in part with
this question, and without attempting here to review the voluminous
literature of the subject, I will content myself with stating
briefly what seems to me to have been established on good
evidence.</p>

<p>There can not, I think, be now any doubt that small tracts of
gneiss, quite comparable in lithological character to portions of
the Lewisian rocks of the north-west of Scotland, rise to the
surface in a few places in England and Wales. In the heart of
Anglesey, for example, a tract of such rocks presents some
striking external or scenic resemblance to the characteristic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">« 13 »</a></span>
types of ground where the oldest gneiss forms the surface in
Scotland and the west of Ireland. In the Malvern Hills another
small knob of somewhat similar material is obviously far more
ancient than the Cambrian rocks of that locality. There may
possibly be still some further exposures of similar rocks in the
south of England, as for instance in southern Cornwall. In
Anglesey a series of schists, quartzites and limestones has been
included by Mr. J. F. Blake with the coarse gneiss above referred
to, and a thick higher group of slates in what he terms the
"Monian" system. These schists, quartzites and limestones
present a close resemblance to the Dalradian series of Scotland
and Ireland, and the quartzites, like those of the Highlands,
contain worm-burrows. The coarse gneiss, as I have said, may
be compared in general character with parts of the Lewisian
rocks, so that we seem to have here, as in Ireland, two groups
of schistose rocks, and both of these must be much older than
the unaltered Cambrian strata which lie above them.</p>

<p>Along the eastern borders of Wales, there is an interrupted
ridge of igneous rocks which were originally supposed to have
broken through the older Palæozoic formations, but which now,
owing mainly to the labors of Dr. Callaway and Professor
Lapworth, are shown to be older than the base of the Cambrian
system. These rocks consist of spherulitic and perlitic felsites,
with volcanic breccias and tuffs. They are undoubtedly older
than the <i>Olenellus</i> zone. Though the evidence is not quite satisfactory,
they may not impossibly lie at the base of a vast mass
of sedimentary rocks forming the ridge of the Longmynd. In
that case the whole of the Longmynd succession with the
volcanic group at its base must be pre-Cambrian and lie unconformably
below the <i>Olenellus</i> zone. Dr. Callaway has proposed
the name "<i>Uriconian</i>" for this volcanic group, while the sedimentary
series has been termed "<i>Longmyndian</i>." On the supposition
that the unconformability is established, there would here be a
vast mass of stratified and partly erupted material forming a pre-Cambrian
formation. Whether in that case any portion of this
English series is the equivalent of the Torridonian rocks of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">« 14 »</a></span>
Scotland remains to be determined. The northwestern part of
the Longmynd ridge is made of red sandstones and conglomerates,
which certainly resemble the Torridonian rocks of Ross and
Sutherland.</p>

<p>At the base of the Cambrian rocks in Wales, Dr. Hicks has
described a marked volcanic series under the name of "Pebidian,"
which he claims as pre-Cambrian, alleging that it is separated
from the Cambrian system by an unconformability, and a band of
conglomerates. I have carefully studied the evidence on this
ground, and have come to the conclusion that there is no
unconformability at the line in question, but that the ordinary
Cambrian strata graduate downwards into the volcanic group and
can not be disjoined from it. I therefore regard the so-called
"Pebidian" as merely marking the duration of a volcanic period
in early Cambrian time.</p>

<p>It will thus be seen that according to my view the unmistakably
pre-Cambrian rocks of Britain consist of, first and oldest,
the Lewisian gneiss; second, the Torridonian sandstones and
conglomerates. The Uriconian and Longmyndian formations
may prove to be in part or in whole equivalents of the Torridonian.
The Dalradian rocks have not yet had their position
determined. They may possibly mark a distinct pre-Cambrian
series, but it seems quite as probable that they are only a
metamorphic complex in which Archæan, Torridonian and
Cambrian, or even Lower Silurian rocks are included.</p>

<h2><a name="TRACES_OF_GLACIAL_MAN" id="TRACES_OF_GLACIAL_MAN">ARE THERE TRACES OF GLACIAL MAN IN THE
TRENTON GRAVELS?</a></h2>


<p>In a paper published in <i>Science</i>, Nov. 25. 1892, I undertook
to study the evidence relating to paleolithic man in the eastern
United States from a new point of view,&mdash;that furnished by certain
recently acquired knowledge of the contents of quarries and
shops where modern aboriginal flaked implements were made.
It was shown that all rudely flaked forms could be sufficiently
accounted for without the necessity of assuming a very rude
state of culture, and that any people, paleolithic or neolithic,
would in roughing out blades&mdash;the principal product of the
flaking process&mdash;produce precisely these forms and in great
numbers as refuse. It further appeared that the finding of these
objects in sporadic cases in glacial gravels or in any formation
whatsoever, could not be considered as proving or tending to
establish the existence of a particular grade of stone-age culture
for the region in which the formation occurs, since they may as
readily pertain to a neolithic as to a paleolithic status. It was
conclusively shown that no worked stone that can with reasonable
safety be called an implement has been reported from the
gravels, and that it is therefore clearly useless, not to say
unscientific, to go on enlarging upon the evidence of an American
paleolithic period and multiplying theoretic details of its
culture.</p>

<p>I now propose to review briefly the question of the age of
our so-called paleolithic implements, the questions of the <i>grade</i>
of a given feature of culture and of the <i>age</i> or chronologic place
of that culture being very properly treated separately, as they
depend for their support upon distinct classes of evidence.
During the past summer, 1892, certain important items of new
evidence have been discovered bearing upon the question of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">« 16 »</a></span>
occurrence or non-occurrence of rudely flaked stones or of any
artificial objects whatsoever in the normal gravels of the Delaware
Valley, and it therefore becomes necessary to examine
somewhat critically such of the published evidence as seems to
be seriously affected by these recent observations.</p>

<p>It may be stated in beginning that no one disputes the glacial
age of the Trenton gravels. The question to be discussed is
simply this,&mdash;is the evidence satisfactory that works of art have
been found in these gravels? Nothing else need be asked or
answered. I do not take up this subject because I love controversy;
disputation is really most distasteful to me. It happens
that under the Bureau of Ethnology of the Smithsonian Institution
I have been assigned to the work of making a survey of the
archeology of the Atlantic coast region in which large areas,
especially in states south of Mason and Dixon's line, remained
almost untouched by investigators, and two years have been
consumed mainly in these southern areas. But there are questions
that refuse to be confined to definite geographic limits, and
evidence secured in one section is sometimes found to bear so
directly and forcibly upon problems pertaining primarily to other
sections that the student of these problems must perforce become
a free lance, and unhesitatingly enter any province promising
results of value, howsoever fully occupied it may be by other
investigators. One of the most interesting and important questions
growing out of the study of American archeology has, as
we have seen, arisen in the Delaware Valley, and the turn taken
by some of my work in the south and west is such that I cannot
pass this question by without consideration. The necessity of
taking up the subject of glacial man became more and more
apparent as the years passed on, and people continued to say to
me, "You must go to Trenton; we are not satisfied with the
present status of the question there; the evidence arrayed in
favor of the theory of a paleolithic gravel man needs critical
examination."</p>

<p>The difficulty of taking up and re-examining evidence, of
which the record only remains, is, however, very great, since in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">« 17 »</a></span>
most cases the evidence rests upon or consists of field observations,
and these cannot be recalled or repeated, and there is
absolutely no means of testing directly the value of what is
recorded. One may seek either to verify or to discredit the
promulgated theories, but years of search may fail to produce a
single new item of evidence bearing decisively upon the subject.
It is possible that at one period numerous finds of implements
should be reported from certain portions of the gravels, and that
afterwards the whole remaining body of these formations should
be worked over and searched without securing a trace of art; yet
this latter evidence, being negative, need not necessarily be considered
sufficient to overturn the original positive evidence if
that happens to be of a high class. There is not the least doubt,
however, that positive evidence may be so impaired by various
defects and inconsistencies, that, unsupported by renewed and
well verified observations, it will finally yield to the negative
forces; and if the theories of a gravel man in the eastern United
States, howsoever fortified by accumulated observations, are not
really properly supported in every way, they are bound in time
to fall to the ground. All I can reasonably hope to do now is to
have the evidence relating to glacial man placed on trial, and so
fully examined and cross-examined that those who accept gravel
man need not longer do so blindly without knowing that there
are two sides to the question, and those who do not accept him
may know something of the reasons for the belief that is in
them.</p>

<p>The evidence employed to prove the presence of a race of
men in the Delaware Valley in glacial times is confined almost
wholly to the alleged discovery of rude implements in the glacial
gravels. Practically all the evidence has been collected by Dr.
C. C. Abbott, and upon his skill as an observer, his faithfulness
as a recorder, his correctness of judgment and his integrity of
character, the whole matter stands. Many visitors, men of high
repute in archeology and geology, have visited the site, but the
observations made on such occasions appear not to have been of
a nature to be of great value in evidence, the finds being doubtful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">« 18 »</a></span>
works of art or not having properly established relationships
with the gravels in place. In the discussion of gravel man in
eastern America a wide range of objects and phenomena has
been considered, but the real evidence, upon which the theory of
an ancient race and a peculiar culture must depend, is furnished by
a hundred pieces&mdash;more or less&mdash;of rudely flaked stones said to
have come from the gravels in place. And now what can be
said with reference to this series of flaked stones further than
that they are reported by the collector to have been found in the
gravels at definite stated depths? I have elsewhere shown that
they are not demonstrably implements in any case, that they are
identical in every respect with the quarry-shop rejects of the
American Indian, that they do not closely resemble any one of
the well established types of European paleolithic implements,
and that they are not a sufficient index of a particular stage of
culture. I shall now present such reasons as there may be for the
belief, held by many, that they were not really found in the
undisturbed glacial gravels.</p>

<p>It is generally understood that the earliest reported gravel
finds of importance were made on the banks of Assanpink creek
within the city limits of Trenton, where the gravels to a thickness
of twenty feet or more were exposed in a railway cutting.
Later the river bluff near the lower end of the city, where the
gravels were exposed to a depth of from twenty-five to forty feet,
yielded large numbers. These two sites, so far as I can learn,
furnished at least three-fourths of the finds in place. Other
specimens were found singly in slight natural exposures, and in
excavations for cellars, sewers, etc., at various points within the
city limits.</p>

<p>The river bluff was for a considerable period the favorite
hunting ground of the searchers for rudely flaked stones, and
many specimens were collected. The gravels were exposed in
a steep, nearly straight bank, several hundred yards in length,
the base of which was washed by the river. There can be no
question that Dr. Abbott and others have found shaped objects
of various classes upon and in the face of this river bluff, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">« 19 »</a></span>
the visitor to-day, although the bluff is now buried almost completely
under city refuse, will hardly fail to find some rudely
flaked form in the deeper gullies or upon the narrow river bank
or beach at the base. Dr. Abbott explicitly states<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> that he
obtained certain of these specimens from the gravel outcrops, and
that they were not in talus formations, but in undisturbed deposits.
How then is it possible to do otherwise than accept these statements
as satisfactory and final?</p>

</div>

<p>Very recently, however, fortunate circumstances have
brought the evidence furnished by this site again within our
reach, thus enabling us to re-open the discussion under favorable
conditions. What I had for some time desired to do in this
case was, what I had already done at Piny Branch, D. C., and
at Little Falls, Minn., to open a trench into the face of the bluff,
and thus secure evidence for or against the theory of a gravel
man. This measure was, however, rendered impracticable by
the occupation of the bluff margin by a city street; but it happened
last summer that the city authorities, desiring to improve
the sanitary condition of the city, decided to open a great sewer
through this very bluff to get a lower outlet to the river. A
trench twelve feet wide and some thirty feet deep, the full depth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">« 20 »</a></span>
of the exposed gravels, was carried along the bluff just inside of
its margin, opening out into the river at the point where the
bluff turns toward the north-east. It was a trenching more complete
and more satisfactory than any of which I had ever
dreamed. At no point for the entire length of the bluff did the
excavation depart more than forty feet from the line of the terrace
face&mdash;from the upper margin of the slope upon which such
plentiful evidence of a supposed gravel man had been obtained.
The accompanying map and section, Figs. 1 and 2, will indicate
the location of the trench, and show the exact relations of the
natural and artificial exposures of the gravels.</p>

<div class="fig_caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 2.</span> Sections made by the river and by the sewer, the former yielding many
"implements," the latter yielding none.</div>
</div>

<p>I made several visits to the place, descended frequently into
the great cut and examined the gravels and their contents with
the utmost care, but without securing a trace of art. Recognizing
the vital importance of utilizing to the fullest extent this
opportunity of testing the art-bearing nature of the gravels at
this point, I resolved to undertake a systematic study of the
subject. Summoning my assistant, Mr. William Dinwiddie,
from his field of operations in the South, I had him spend
upwards of a month at the great trench, faithfully watching the
gravels as they were exposed. Mr. Dinwiddie had worked
three years under my personal direction, and had helped open
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">« 21 »</a></span>
upwards of twenty trenches through similar gravel deposits, and
was therefore well qualified for the work. Prof. W. J. McGee,
Prof. R. D. Salisbury, Dr. Stewart Culin and Dr. Abbott also
visited the place one or more times each. Relics of art were
found upon the surface and in such portions of the talus as happened
to be exposed, but nothing whatever was found in the
gravels in place, and the search was closed when it became
fully apparent that the case was hopeless.</p>

<p>It may be claimed that the conditions under which gravels
are exposed in trenching as it progresses, are not as favorable
for the collection of enclosed relics as where exposed by natural
processes of weathering. This is true in a certain measure, as
specimens may be obscured by the damp clinging sand which
forms the matrix of the gravels. This, however, would interfere
but little with the discovery of large flaked stones, such as we
were led to expect in this place, and this slight disadvantage in
detecting shaped pieces in fresh exposures is more than over-balanced
by the treachery of weathered surfaces which often
give to intrusive objects the appearance of original inclusion.
The opportunity for studying the gravels in all their phases of
bedding, composition and contents, was really excellent, and no
one could watch the constantly renewed exposures hour after
hour for a month without forming a most decided notion as to
the implement bearing qualities of the formation. Not the
trace of a flaked stone, or of a flake or artificial fragment of any
kind was found, and we closed the work with the firm conviction
that the gravels exposed by this trench were absolutely barren of
art. But Dr. Abbott claims to have found numerous implements
in the bluff face a few feet away and in the same gravels. If
this is true, the conditions of glacial occupation of this site must
have been indeed remarkable. It is implied that during the
whole period occupied by the melting of the ice sheet within the
drainage of the Delaware valley the hypothetical rude race lived
on a particular line or zone afterwards exposed by the river to
the depth of 30 feet, leaving his strange "tools" there by the hundreds,
while another line or zone, not more than forty feet away
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">« 22 »</a></span>
at most, exposed to the same depth by an artificial trench, was
so avoided by him that it does not furnish the least memento
of his presence. One vertical slice of the gravels twelve feet
thick does not yield even a broken stone, while another slice not
probably one-half as thick, cut obliquely through the gravels
near by, has furnished subject-matter for numerous books and
substantiation for a brace of theories. That no natural line
of demarcation between the two section lines is possible, is
shown by the fact that the formations are continuous, and that
the deposits indicate a constant shifting of lines and areas of
accumulation; thus it was impossible for any race to dwell continuously
upon any spot, line or plane. This is well shown in the
section, <a href="#Fig_3">Fig. 3</a>, which gives the relations of the art-producing section
of Dr. Abbott to the non-art-producing section of the sewer.
The gravels were laid down entirely irrespective of subsequent
cutting, natural or artificial; yet we are expected to believe that
a so-called gravel man could have resorted for a thousand years
to the space <i>a</i>, leaving his half shaped or incipient tools at all
stages of the gravel building from base to top, failing entirely to
visit a neighboring space <i>b</i>, or to leave there a single flake to
reward the most faithful search. It is much easier to believe
that one man should err than that a guileless race should thus
conspire with a heartless nature to accomplish such extraordinary
results. The easier explanation of the whole matter is that the
objects found by Dr. Abbott were not really in the gravels, but
that they are Indian shop-refuse settled into the old talus
deposits of the bluff, and that his eager eyes, blinded by a prevailing
belief in a paleolithic man for all the world alike, failed
to observe with their wonted keenness and power.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">« 23 »</a></span></p>

<p>But this case does not stand alone. The first discoveries of
supposed gravel implements are said to have been made when
the Pennsylvania Railway opened a road bed through the creek
terrace on the site of the present station. At first numerous
specimens of rudely flaked stones were reported, and the locality
became widely known to archeologists, but the implement
bearing portions of the gravels&mdash;and this is a most significant
fact&mdash;were limited in extent, and the deposit was soon completely
removed, the horizontal extension containing nothing.
At present there are excellent exposures of the full thickness of
the gravels at this point, but the most diligent search is vain,
the only result of days of examination being a deep conviction
that these gravels are and always were wholly barren
of art.</p>

<p>It thus appears that here as well as upon the river front, the
works of art were confined to local deposits, limited horizontally
but not vertically, and a strong presumption is created that the
finds were confined to redistributed gravels settled upon the
terrace face in the form of talus. Dr. Abbott states that "at
that point where I gathered the majority of specimens there is a
want of stratification."<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> It is well known that such rearranged
deposits are often difficult to distinguish from the original
gravels. In trenching an implement producing terrace at Washington&mdash;where
the conditions were probably quite similar to
those at the Trenton railroad station&mdash;I passed through eighty
feet of redistributed talus gravels before encountering the gravels
in place, and so deceptively were portions of these deposits re-set
that experts in gravel phenomena were unable to decide whether
they were or were not portions of the original formation
(cretaceous). The question was finally settled by the discovery
of artificially shaped stones in and beneath the deposits.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">« 24 »</a></span></p>

<p>Again, an implement bearing deposit of gravel was recently
discovered by the late Miss F. E. Babbitt at Little Falls,
Minnesota, and sufficient (a very little) digging was done to
satisfy the discoverer, and all paleolithic archeologists as well,
that the objects were really imbedded in the glacial gravels. In
the summer of 1892 I visited the place and carried a trench
twenty feet horizontally into the terrace face on the "implement
bed" level before encountering the gravels in place. The talus
deposits were several feet thick, and were of such a nature that
their true character could not be determined without careful and
extensive trenching. The whole talus deposit was here well
stocked with Indian quartz quarry-shop rejects, which were as
usual of paleolithic types, and it was but natural that Miss
Babbitt's conclusions, although based as they necessarily were
upon inexpert observations, backed by such well known "types"
of "implements" should be unhesitatingly accepted by believers.</p>

<p>The occurrence of these telling examples of the deceptive
appearance of re-set gravels would seem to justify and emphasize
the conviction created by a critical examination of the two
leading so-called paleolithic sites at Trenton, that Dr. Abbott,
notwithstanding his asseverations to the contrary, has been
deceived. Very strong support, it seems to me, is given to this
conclusion by the recently published opinion of the late Dr. H.
Carvill Lewis, a glacialist familiar with the Trenton region, and
with the work of Dr. Abbott at the period of his paleolithic
castle building. Dr. Lewis is reported to have maintained
before an open meeting of the Academy of Science in Philadelphia
"that what Dr. Abbott believed to be undisturbed layers
(of gravel) were those of an ancient talus."<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> This remark
may refer to both the main sites&mdash;the one at the railroad
station and the other at the river front&mdash;or possibly only
to the former. I have also heard it stated that that eminent
scholar, Dr. Leidy, who must have had ample opportunities of
forming correct opinions upon the subject, held pretty much
the same views of Dr. Abbott's finds.</p>

</div>

<p>To make the above criticism entirely clear, a few words of
explanation of talus phenomena may be added. As a river cuts
its channel deeper and deeper into deposits of gravel a section
is gradually exposed, but the gravels break down readily under
atmospheric influences and the exposed face does not retain a
high angle. The upper part crumbles and descends toward the
base, there to rest against the slope or to be carried away by the
stream. A supposititious case will be convenient for illustration.
A gravel terrace twenty feet in height is encroached upon by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">« 26 »</a></span>
river at high water and undermined, and the face breaks down
vertically, leaving an exposure as illustrated in <a href="#Fig_4">Fig. 4</a>. In a very
short time the upper portions become loosened and fall below,
giving a steep slope as seen in <a href="#Fig_5">Fig. 5</a>. The process goes on
with gradually decreasing rapidity, and if the river does not
again encroach seriously, a practically stable slope is reached,
as shown in <a href="#Fig_6">Fig. 6</a>. Such a talus may be hundreds or even
thousands of years old, but there is rarely any means of determining
its exact age. If the gravels are homogeneous in character,
the talus will simulate their normal condition so completely
that the distinction cannot be made out in ordinary gullies or by
unsystematic digging. If the gravels contain varied strata the
talus will be composite, and will be more readily distinguished
from at least portions of the material in place.</p>

<p>Now it is important to observe what may be the possible art
contents of such a talus as that shown in <a href="#Fig_6">Fig. 6</a>. It may contain
all objects of art originally included in that portion of the
gravels represented by <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, together with all articles that happened
to be upon the surface <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, beside such objects as may
have accumulated from dwelling or shop work upon its own
surface, after the slope became sufficiently reduced to be occupied
for these purposes. A talus is therefore liable to contain,
and in the utmost confusion, relics of all periods of occupation,
supposing always that there were such periods, from the beginning
of the formation of the gravel deposits down to the present
moment. As a rule such a talus, if art-containing, will have a
large percentage of shop and quarry-shop refuse, for the reason
that the exposed gravels, and the banks and beds of rivers cutting
them, furnish, as a rule, a good deal of the raw material
utilized by workers in stone, and the shops in which the work
was done are usually located upon the slopes and outer margins
of the terraces. Although there is the possibility of very considerable
age for these talus deposits, it is unlikely that any
of them date back as far as the close of the glacial epoch or at
all near it, for rivers change back and forth constantly, undermining
first one bank and then the other, so that a very large
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">« 27 »</a></span>
percentage of our talus deposits have been formed well within
the historic period.</p>

<p>At Trenton the constantly exposed gravel banks afforded
considerable argillite in bowlders, fragments and heavy masses,
as well as some other flakable stones of inferior quality little
used, and it is inevitable that the Indian who dwelt upon the
shores of the river should have sought the workable pieces
along the bluff, leaving the refuse everywhere; and it is a necessary
consequence that the terrace margin, the bluff face, and
the talus deposits, places little fitted for habitation, should for
long distances contain no trace of any art shapes save such as
pertain to manufacture. Thus are fully and satisfactorily
accounted for all the turtle backs and other rude forms that our
paleolith hunters have been so assiduously gathering. Nothing
can be more fully apparent than that no other race than the
Indian in his historic character and condition need be conjured
up to reasonably account for every phase and every article of
the recovered art. Mistaken interpretations of the nature of
shop rejects, and the common association of these objects with
redistributed gravels, are probably accountable for the many
misconceptions that have arisen. Talus deposits form exceedingly
treacherous records for the would-be chronologist. They
are the reef upon which more than one paleolithic adventurer
has been wrecked.</p>

<p>Relics of art attributed to gravel man have been collected,
so far as I can gather from museum labels and from incidental
references in various publications, from a number of sites aside
from the two already referred to. These are scattered over the
city, and the finds were made mostly in exposures of the gravels
that remained visible for a short time only, as in street and
cellar excavations and well pits. These reported finds can never
be brought within the range of re-examination, and the searcher
after unimpeachable testimony must content himself with placing
them in the doubtful column on general principles. Urban
districts are so subject to disturbance through cutting down of
hills, filling in of depressions, grading of streets, digging of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">« 28 »</a></span>
foundations, cellars, sewers, wells and graves that no man can,
from a limited exposure such as those producing the reported
tools necessarily were, speak with certainty of the undisturbed
nature of the deposits penetrated. It is doubtful if any one is
justified in publishing such observations at all without serious
query. Such testimony is liable to fall of its own inherent weakness,
being absolutely valueless if unsupported by collateral
evidence of real weight. It can only be made permanently
available to science by the discovery of something unusual or
unique with which to couple it, something decidedly un-Indian
in character or type, as for example the two skulls now in the
Peabody Museum. These objects and the antler knife-handle
exhibited with them may be alluded to as the only finds so far
made at Trenton, having of themselves the least potentiality as
proof and these skulls and this knife-handle must yet be
subjected to the rigid examination made necessary by the
importance of the conclusions to be based upon them.</p>

<p>Something may now be said concerning the art remains upon
which this discussion hinges, and upon which conclusions of the
greatest importance to anthropology are supposed to depend.
Let us pass over all that has been said with regard to their
manner of occurrence and association with the gravels and ask
them simply what story they tell of themselves. Does this
story, so far as we are able clearly to read it, speak of a great
antiquity and a peculiar culture, or does it hint rather at vital
weaknesses in the position taken by the advocates of these ideas?
We shall see. The history of the utilization of rudely flaked
stones in the attempt to establish a gravel man in America has
never been written, but as read between the lines of paleolithic
literature, it runs about as follows: The theory of a very rude
and ancient people, having a unique culture and certain peculiar
art limitations, was developed in Europe many years ago in a
manner well known and often rehearsed. This people was
associated with the ice age in Europe, and this epoch, with its
moraines and till and sedimented gravels, was found to have
been repeated in America. It was the most natural thing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">« 29 »</a></span>
possible that these discoveries should carry with them the suggestion
that man may have existed here as in Europe during
that epoch, and that his culture was of closely corresponding
grade. These were legitimate inferences and warranted the
instituting of careful researches, but it was a dangerous suggestion
to put into the minds of enthusiastic novices with fertile
brains and ready pens. The idea was hardly transplanted to
American soil before finds began to be made. The so-called
"types" of European paleoliths suggested the lines upon which
finds here should be made, and everything in the way of flaked
stones connected directly or indirectly with the glacial gravels
which had not yet been fully credited to and absorbed by the
inconvenient Indian, was seized upon as representing the ancient
time and its hypothetic people and culture. In the early days
of the investigation the various rude forms of flaked stones,
resulting from failures in manufacture, had not been studied, and
were shrouded in convenient mystery, and they thus became the
foundation of the new archeologic dynasty in America, the
dynasty of the turtle-back. Dr. Abbott states in his first work<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
that these rude "implements" are not especially characteristic
of any one locality, but seem to be scattered uniformly over the
state. Specimens of every type, he says, are "found upon the
surface, and are plowed up every spring and autumn; but this
in no way militates against the opinion that these ruder forms
are far older than the well-chipped jasper and beautifully-polished
porphyry stone-work."<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> At that stage of the investigation it was
not at all necessary that a specimen should come from the gravels
in place or from any given depth, since the "type" was supposed
to be easily recognized and was a sufficient means of
settling the question of age.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_4" id="Footnote_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> Abbott, C. C. The Stone Age in N. J., Sm. Rep. 1875, p. 247.</p></div>

<p>Rude "implements" were called for and they were found.
The only requirements were that they should not be of well-known
Indian types, that they should be rude and have some
sort of resemblance to what were known as paleolithic implements
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">« 30 »</a></span>
abroad. Since most of these so-called gravel implements of
Europe are also doubtless the rejects of manufacture resemblances
were readily found. The early attempts to utilize these rejects
in support of the theory, and make them masquerade creditably
as "implements" with specialized features and self-evident
adaptation to definite ice-age uses, now appear decidedly amusing.
Gradually, however, the lines have been drawn upon this
early license, and it is to-day well understood by all careful
students, that since the rude forms are so often repeated in
modern neolithic refuse, the only reliable test of a gravel
"implement" is its occurrence in the gravels in place. That a
particular "implement," said to have been obtained from the
gravels, is of "paleolithic type," does not in the least strengthen
its claims to being a <i>bona fide</i> gravel implement; nor does its
easy assignment to a "type" give any additional value to the
collector's claim that the gravels said to contain it are implement
bearing. The very names, "rude implement," "paleolithic
implement," etc., carry with them a certain amount of mysterious
suggestion; one thinks of unique, significant shapes and
of strange, archaic uses. At their mere mention, the great ice
sheet looms up with startling realism, and the reindeer and the
mighty mammoth appear upon the scene. The reader of our
paleolithic literature is led to feel that these antiquated objects
carry volumes of history in their worn and weather-beaten faces,
but this is all the figment of fertile brains. These objects have
without exception the appearance of the most commonplace
every-day rejects of manufacture without specialization and
without hidden meaning. They tell of themselves no story
whatsoever, save that of the oft-repeated failure of the aboriginal
blade maker in his struggle with refractory stones. This
will be shown with greater clearness farther on.</p>

<p>But the scheme does not end with the repetition of a European
state of affairs. Our gravel archeologists have not been
content to adopt that feature of the foreign scheme which
utterly destroys the paleolithic race before a higher culture is
brought upon the scene. It was thought to improve upon the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">« 31 »</a></span>
borrowed plan by allowing for a gradual development upward
from the paleolithic stage, represented exclusively by a class of
meaningless bits of flaked stone, through a period less rude,
characterized by productions so far advanced as to be assigned
to a definite use. These latter productions consist mainly of
rather large and often rude blades, sometimes plain, but generally
notched or modified at the broader end as if to be set in a
handle, or attached to a spear or arrow shaft. These were
assigned to post-glacial times in such a way as to bridge or
partly bridge the great space between the glacial epoch and the
present. They were separated arbitrarily from the body of the
collections of the region, and referred to as probably the work
of an Eskimo race. This arrangement produced a pleasing
symmetry and completeness, and brought the history of man
down to the beginning of the Indian epoch, which is represented
by all of those forms of art with which the red man is
historically associated.</p>

<p>Three principal periods are thus thought to be represented
by the finds at Trenton; and in the arrangement of the collections
these grand divisions are illustrated by three great groups
of relics, which are looked upon by the founders of the scheme
as an epitome of native American art and culture. By others
this grouping is looked upon as purely empirical, as an arbitrary
separation of the normal art remains of the historic Indian, not
suggested by anything in the nature or condition of the objects,
nor in the manner of their discovery.</p>

<p>The "Eskimo" feature of the scheme requires a more
detailed examination than can be given it here. It may be
stated, however, that the separation of the so-called Eskimo
spear points, or whatever they may be, from the great body of
associated articles of flaked stone, appears to be a highly arbitrary
proceeding. That they were extensively made by the
Indians is proved by the occurrence of refuse resulting from
their manufacture on modern shop sites, and that they were used
by the Indian, is equally apparent from their common occurrence
on modern dwelling sites. The exceptionally large size of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">« 32 »</a></span>
argellite points is readily accounted for by the nature of the
material. It was the only stone of the region well adapted to
the manufacture of long blades or projectile points. Jasper,
quartz and flint have such minute cleavage that, save in rare
cases, small implements only could be made from them. Their
peculiar manner of occurrence, described at so much length by
Dr. Abbott,<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> has been given undue consideration and weight.
The phenomena observed may all be accounted for as a result of
the vicissitudes of aboriginal life and occupation within the last
few hundred years as fully and satisfactorily as by jumping
thousands of years backward into the unknown.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_6" id="Footnote_6"></a><a href="#FNanchor_6"><span class="label">[6]</span></a> Abbott, C. C. Popular Science Monthly, Dec., 1889.</p></div>

<p>Whatsoever real support there may be for the "Eskimo"
theory, either in the published or the unpublished evidence, it is
apparent that under the present system of solitary and inexpert
research, the scientific world will gain little that it can utilize
without distrust and danger. Whatsoever may be the final outcome&mdash;which
outcome is bound to be the truth&mdash;it is clear that
there is little in the present evidence to warrant the separation
of a "paleolithic" and an "Eskimo" period of art from
that of the Indian.</p>

<p>That the art remains of the Trenton region are essentially a
unit, having no natural separation into time, culture or stock
groups, is easily susceptible of demonstration. I have already
presented strong reasons for concluding that all the finds upon
the Trenton sites are from the surface or from recent deposits,
and that all may reasonably be assigned to the Indian. A find
has recently been made which furnishes full and decisive evidence
upon this point. At Point Pleasant, on the Delaware,
some twenty-five miles above Trenton, there are outcrops of
argillite, and here have been discovered recently the shop sites
upon which this stone was worked. There are two features of
these shops to which the closest attention must be given. The
first is that they are manifestly modern; they are situated on
the present flood plain of the Delaware, and but a few feet above
average water level, the glacial terrace here being some forty or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">« 33 »</a></span>
fifty feet in height. These shops, therefore, represent the most
modern phases of aboriginal industry, and may have been occupied
at the coming of William Penn. The second point is that
every type of flaked argillite found in the Trenton region, associated
with the gravels or otherwise, is found on this site. It
was to a certain extent a quarry site, for the great masses of
argillite brought down by the floods were here broken up and
removed from the river banks or bed. It was a shop site, for
here the articles, mainly blades, were roughed out, and it was
also a dwelling place&mdash;a village site&mdash;where all the specialized
forms of flaked stones made from the blades were prepared for
use. Here are found great numbers of the rude failures, duplicating
every feature of the mysterious "paleolith" with which
our museums are stocked, and exhibiting the same masterly
quitting at just the point "where no further shaping was possible."<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
Here we see the same boldly manipulated "cutting
edge," the "flat bottom" and "high peak," and the same mysteriously
weathered and disintegrated surfaces, so skillfully
made, by a nice balancing of accidents,<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> to tell the story of
chronologic sequence in deposition.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_7" id="Footnote_7"></a><a href="#FNanchor_7"><span class="label">[7]</span></a> Abbott, C. C. Smithsonian Report, 1875, p. 248.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_8" id="Footnote_8"></a><a href="#FNanchor_8"><span class="label">[8]</span></a> Ibid. Primitive Industry, p. 487.</p></div>

<p>Beside the failures, we have here, as on other quarry shop
sites, the evidence of more advanced work, the wide, thick,
defective blades, and many of the long, thin blades broken at or
near the finishing point. Here, too, just back of the roughing-out
shops, are the dwelling sites from which many specialized
forms are obtained. The "Eskimo" type is fully represented
as well as the ordinary spear point, the arrow point, and the
perforator of our Indian. There is not a type of flaked argillite
known in the Delaware valley that may not be duplicated here
on this modern Indian site, and this has been known by local
archeologists for years. Why so little has been said about the
matter is thus explained. Dr. Abbott, in 1890, discovering this
site, and finding "typical paleolithic implements" (the ordinary
ruder forms of rejects) among the refuse, was so entirely at a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">« 34 »</a></span>
loss to explain the occurrence that he felt compelled to again
"take up the examination of the gravel deposits of the valley of
the Delaware" with the hope of "finally solving the problem."<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
The true conditions would have been at once apparent to any
one not utterly blinded by the prevailing misconceptions.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_9" id="Footnote_9"></a><a href="#FNanchor_9"><span class="label">[9]</span></a> Abbott, C. C. Annual Report of the Curator of the Museum of American
Archeology, University of Pennsylvania. No. 1, p. 7.</p></div>

<p>The entire simplicity of the archeologic conditions in the
Delaware valley may be further illustrated. Had William Penn
paused in his arduous traffic with the tawny Delawares, and
glanced out with far-sighted eyes from beneath the pendant
branches of the great elm at Shackamaxon, he might have
beheld an uncouth savage laboriously fabricating rude ice age
tools, making the clumsy turtle-back, shaping the mysterious
paleolith, thus taking that first and most interesting theoretical
step in human art and history. Had he looked again a few
moments later he might have beheld the same tawny individual
deeply absorbed in the task of trimming a long rude spear point
of "Eskimo" type from the refractory argillite. If he had
again paused when another handful of baubles had been judiciously
exchanged, he would have seen the familiar redskin
carefully finishing his arrow points and fitting them to their
shafts preparatory to a hunting and fishing cruise on the placid
Delaware. Thus in a brief space of time Penn might have
gleaned the story of the ages&mdash;the history of the turtle-back,
the long spear point and their allies&mdash;as in a single sheaf. But
the opportunity was wasted, and the heaps of flinty refuse left
upon the river bank by the workmen were the only record left
of the nature of the work of that day. Two hundred years of
aboriginal misfortune and Quaker inattention and neglect have
resulted in so mixing up the simple evidence of a day's work,
that it has taken twenty-five years to collect the scattered fragments,
to sift, separate and classify them, and to assign them to
theoretic places in a scheme of culture evolution that spans ten
thousand years.</p>

<p>Yet is there really nothing in it all, in the theories, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">« 35 »</a></span>
observations, the collections and the books? Do I speak too
positively in condemnation of the results of years of earnest
investigation? Perhaps so, but the voluminous testimony is so
overloaded with inaccuracies, the relics of unscientific method
and misleading hypotheses, that every item must be sharply
questioned; and the conclusions reached so far overstep the
limits warranted by the evidence, that heroic measures alone can
be effectual in determining their exact value. If, as many
believe, vital errors have been embodied in the evidence presented
by the advocates of the theory, it is impossible to state
the case too strongly. Error once fully absorbed into the literature
of science has many advantages over the tardy truth; it is
strongly fortified and must be attacked and exposed without fear
or favor. Truth involved with it cannot permanently suffer.
If the twin theories of a gravel and a paleolithic man in eastern
America are to be assailed as unsound or as not properly supported,
it should be done now while the originators and upholders
are alive and alert to sustain their positions or to yield to the
advances of truth. I do not wish to wrongly characterize or to
unduly minimize the evidence brought to bear in favor of these
theories. I do intend, however, to assist the world so far as
possible in securing an exact estimate of all that has been said
and done, and all that is to be done.</p>

<p>In a previous article I have examined the evidence relating
to paleolithic art in the eastern United States, and have indicated
its utter inadequacy and unreliability. In this paper the testimony
relating to the occurrence of gravel art, in the locality
most fully relied upon by advocates of the theory, has been
partially reviewed and subjected to the strong light of recent
observations. It is found that the whole fabric, so imposing
in books and museums, shrinks away surprisingly as it is
approached. The evidence furnished by the bluff face and by
the railway cutting, the two leading sites, is fatally weakened by
the practical demonstration of the fact that the gravels proper
are at these points barren of art remains. In endeavoring to
naturalize an immigrant hypothesis, our gravel searchers, unacquainted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">« 36 »</a></span>
with the true nature of the objects collected and
discussed, and little skilled in the observation of the phenomena
by means of which all questions of age must be determined,
have undoubtedly made grievous mistakes and have thus
misled an expectant and credulous public.</p>

<p>The articles themselves, the so-called gravel finds, when
closely studied are found to tell their own story much more
fully and accurately than it has heretofore been read by students
of archeology. This story is that the art of the Delaware valley
is to all intents and purposes a unit, that there is nothing
unique or especially primitive or ancient and nothing un-Indian
in it all. All forms are found on demonstrably recent sites of
manufacture. The rude forms assigned by some to glacial times
are all apparently "wasters" of Indian manufacture. The large
blades of "Eskimo" type are only the larger blades, knives and
spear points of the Indian, separated arbitrarily from the body
of the art-remains to subserve the ends of a theory, certain
obscure phenomena of occurrence having been found to give
color to the proceeding. To place any part of this art, rude or
elaborate, permanently in any other than the ordinary Indian
category will take stronger proofs than have yet been developed
in the region itself.</p>

<p>The question asked in the beginning, "Are there traces of
glacial man in the Trenton gravels?" if not answered decisively
in the negative, stands little chance, considering present evidence,
of being answered in the affirmative. In view of the fact
that numerous observations of apparent value have been made
in other sections, there is yet sufficient reason for letting the
query stand, and we may continue to cherish the hope that possibly
by renewed effort and improved methods of investigation,
something may yet be found in the Trenton gravels clearly
demonstrative of the fascinating belief in a great antiquity for the
human race in America.</p>

<p>The evidence upon which <i>paleolithic man</i> in America depends
is so intangible that, unsupported by supposed analogies with
European conditions and phenomena, and by the suggestions of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">« 37 »</a></span>
an ideal scheme of culture progress, it would vanish in thin air;
and if the theory of a <i>glacial man</i> can summon to its aid no better
testimony than that furnished by the examples examined in this
paper, the whole scheme, so elaborately mounted and so confidently
proclaimed, is in imminent danger of early collapse.</p>

<h2><a name="GEOLOGY_PART_OF_COLLEGE" id="GEOLOGY_PART_OF_COLLEGE">GEOLOGY AS A PART OF A COLLEGE
CURRICULUM.</a></h2>


<p>The demand for scientific studies as a part of the college
curriculum is felt by all those who have to do with the provision
of higher instruction for American youth. The reasons for this
may be various, but a fundamental reason is found in the tendency
among the American people in particular, and in this age
in general, toward practicality in all things. Applied to education
this practicality asks for a training which shall have a direct
bearing upon the business of life to be followed immediately
after the training period is ended. It means a differentiation of
subjects and specialization in methods to adjust the education
to the different functions which the students taking it are preparing
for. It calls for a professional education for those who
expect to become lawyers, doctors, ministers, or teachers,&mdash;a
technical education for those who are to engage in the arts of
the mechanical or civil engineer, or of the architect. It results
not only in the establishment of colleges and universities
devoted to this kind of education, but it affects the methods
of the high schools and academies, and is felt down to primary
schools, and on the other hand the older institutions founded
on a different plan are adapted to the popular demand by the
addition to the regular studies of "electives," chosen not always
for their value or disciplinary studies, but because of the
practical applicability of the information to be derived from
them, to the business of the student.</p>

<p>Without discussing the relative merits of the two ideas of
education, the chief contrast between them may be found in the
character of the results sought. The knowledge of things and
their uses is of chief importance in the practical education; the
knowledge of ideas and skill in their use is the aim of the liberal
education. Geology is one of the sciences which most men will at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">« 39 »</a></span>
once classify as among the practical sciences. It deals with matters
of practical importance to everybody. Coal, iron, the metals,
silver, gold, tin, lead, building stone, sand, clay, petroleum, and
natural gas, and all geological products are essential materials of
modern civilization, and a knowledge of them and of their
modes and places of occurrence is one of the requisites of an
education, either from the practical or the liberal point of view.
So too the dynamics of atmospheric and hydraulic erosion, the
agency of rivers and oceans in destruction, removal and reconstruction
of geological formations have their eminently practical
bearings upon the various arts of engineering. While the
practical value of geology is thus evident and undisputed, it
is not on this account that its importance as a part of a college
course of education is urged. As a practical study geology
becomes the centre of a group of studies requiring years for
mastery. Chemistry and physics are primarily essential to a full
understanding of the most common of geological problems.
And to use geological facts and phenomena, an acquaintance
with the complex methods of engineering, civil and mechanical,
which again call for a thorough mastery of mathematics, is
necessary. Mineralogy and petrography, metallurgy and mining
engineering have each reached a stage of development entitling
them to the rank of separate sciences, but the practical training
of the geologist should include them all. When we add the
biological sciences connected with historical geology, paleontology,
zoölogy and botany, with all the laboratory and field
work required for their proper study, we have a group of
affiliated branches of learning requiring four or five years of
continuous study after the student has learned how to study.
It is plain therefore that only a specialist, one who is willing
to neglect other studies, or who has previously had a liberal
training, can perfect himself on the practical side in the science
of geology.</p>

<p>But irrespective of its practical uses, as a means of training
and supplementary to the ordinary studies of a college curriculum,
geology is one of the most useful of the sciences of observation.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">« 40 »</a></span>
It is in providing that particular training to which
President Eliot has recently called attention in the <i>Forum</i> (Dec.,
1892, Wherein Popular Education Has Failed), that geology
can be used to such advantage. Speaking particularly of the
lower education, President Eliot says it is "the judgment and
reasoning powers" that particularly require attention. Their
systematic development is to be attained in the four directions
of "observing accurately, recording correctly, comparing,
grouping and inferring justly, and expressing cogently the
results of these mental operations." (p. 421.) The attainment
of these ends is one of the purposes of liberal education, whether
it be in the primary school or in the university. And geology,
or any other science, is of value in a college course in proportion
to its fitness for the exercise and development of these functions
of the student. Geology may be taught without regard to these
ends, and then it is valuable from the practical point of view,
but when we examine it in respect of its availability as a disciplinary
study we find it offering particular attractions.</p>

<p>Using the distinction between theory and practice, which is
as old as Aristotle, geology in its theoretical aspect is more easily
comprehended than is the theoretical aspect of most of the
modern sciences. This arises first from the fact that the facts
and phenomena are of a simple and grand nature, making it possible
for the teacher to direct certain attention to the specific
facts under consideration. The water of the rivers, the mud by
the road side, the rocks and sands on the shore are familiar
objects to all, and it is a simple matter to call attention by
ordinary language to the specific facts regarding them, which,
analyzed out, are to form the basis of exact ideas and scientific
definition and classification. Geology is the one science among
the natural sciences which may begin with the common language
of the pupil, and by means of such language alone may build up
ideas of precise phenomena in scientific terms. Physiography
or physical geography surpasses geology proper in this particular,
as the admirable work of Professor Davis is showing,
and on this account it is the best introduction to geology. But
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">« 41 »</a></span>
the very largeness and indefiniteness of the facts are in the way
of the use of physical geography for the exercise of the finer
and more exact functions of observation. The disciplinary
value of classics and mathematics is to a considerable extent
derived from this quality, the precision with which the words or
figures kindle like ideas. So long as the object of the training
is to teach the knowledge of ideas and how to use them, classics
and mathematics are the simplest and purest means of developing
a liberal education. The addition of sciences to the college
course is not because of the usefulness of the knowledge of
things thus to be gained, but because the language of the sciences
is essential to call forth the observation and the exercise of the
accompanying mental operations.</p>

<p>When it comes to dealing with the ideas associated with particular
sense-observation, where form or motion can not be
expressed in simple mathematical terms, language can not communicate
a new idea or kindle it in another mind with precision.
It is necessary by some means to recall or to present the object
itself to the student. In the teaching of science this point is of
great importance, and much of the unsatisfactoriness of science-teaching
is doubtless due to failure to note it. No circumlocution
of words can arouse in another or communicate to him the
idea appropriate to a sensation he has never felt. The blind
man whose eyes are opened sees men as trees walking.</p>

<p>In the use of science for elementary training (and the training
is elementary until the student is capable of investigating
and interpreting the facts and phenomena of a science directly)
that science is the better which deals with objects which are simple,
common and easily observed. Such is geology in some of
its aspects. Every time the student walks in the country he
sees the facts discussed in the text-book or by his teacher; and
from attention to those with which he is already familiar he can
be readily led to observe and give attention to others and to
analyze those already in his mind by properly directed questions.</p>

<p>In the field of geology are found the ready means for the
exercise and development of observation and thought. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">« 42 »</a></span>
learner begins with ideas which every intelligent mind associates
with the objects described or named, and by degrees the marks
of his knowledge are increased, the relations of things are
grasped, and the content of his ideas associated with the language
of his science is enlarged. In the process of learning
the science he has been building up his stock of knowledge of
facts and phenomena, but, of more importance than that, he has
learned the method of observing and of scientific thinking. He
has had training in the methods of reducing the hard facts of
nature to the laws of thought and practice, he has seen the
method by which theoretical order is made out of the interminable
confusion and complexity of natural things.</p>

<p>Beside this primary reason for the use of geology as a disciplinary
science-study, there is a second reason arising from the
symbolic nature of a large group of its facts. This aspect of
the science is best seen in the historical and stratigraphical parts
of geology, in which fossils are the chief data for study. The
interpretation of a fossil into a species of organism, having its
definite place in the elaborate classification of the zoölogist, or
as an indicator of the time and place and mode of formation of
the strata in which it is buried, is, to be sure, a most intricate
and, at first thought it would seem, an unattractive process. But
no more so, I would say, than the interpretation of a series of
Greek characters. The interpretation of the Greek reveals to
us the richest results of human thought and most perfect laws
of human speech, and we find therefore in the analysis required
the most perfect discipline of the powers of speech and language.
The fossil too holds, ready to be revealed, the story of
the history of the world and the laws of the evolution of the
organic life of the globe, and records an inexhaustible wealth
of information regarding the laws of nature. But as an instrument
of intellectual discipline its great merit lies in its symbolic
nature. It is this symbolic character of the classical languages
and of the mathematics which fits them to be universal means
of liberal training. The symbolic nature of the fossil fits it to
become the exponent of training in the pure science of nature.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">« 43 »</a></span>
The fossil is a mark which stands for something, and thus,
in the nature of things, it asks for interpretation. As a symbol
it stimulates minute and accurate observation, and kindles close
and exhaustive thought; as a symbol it leaves us the ideas it
has engendered after it is lost to memory as an observation.
Thus the value of its study does not depend upon the retention
in the memory of the facts brought before the mind, but in
the training of the mental processes required in its interpretation.
The study of this branch of geology exercises and
develops all the faculties which are specially exercised in any
scientific investigation.</p>

<p>Another aspect in which it is an ideal means for such
training comes from the fact that it is equally valuable at
every stage of progress of the student. When first examined
it means nothing to him. He knows nothing of organism,
of strata, of geological time. The fossil gains meaning only
as he is able to put meaning into it. The student must
ask questions, and as step by step he answers his questions
by more minute and wider examination, the fossil holds a fuller
interpretation. His studies lead him to investigation of the
whole field of nature, the rocks, the formation of deposits, the
action of the elements, the conditions of life, the forms of organism,
their functions and habits, the laws of growth, their adaptation
to environment, the changes of events in time, the efforts
of association and struggle for life, the principles of evolution
and development&mdash;the migration and origin and extinction of
organisms on the globe. Nothing in nature is without interest
to him. Further than this the amount of good he gains is not
measured by the number of fossils he studies, but by the wideness
of his research. A handful of fossils from some one fossiliferous
ledge may be the text for a year's study, and the methods
acquired in the study may be the nucleus of a life's work.
In this department of geology the possibilities for new
discoveries, new developments of science are almost endless.
As a single author thoroughly read develops a wealth of knowledge
of the laws of language and thought, so geology may be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">« 44 »</a></span>
studied by the use of a limited set of its phenomena and become
the introduction to the exhaustive study of natural science.</p>

<p>Another advantage attaching to geology as a science-study
for the college curriculum, arises from the fact that it may be
pursued deeply without the elaborate aid to the senses required
in other sciences for making minute record or measurement of
facts or phenomena. As in language and mathematics, it is
essential to acquire a familiarity with the grammar, the dictionary
and the symbols, formulas and rules of their usage before
the finer training in the use of thought begins, so the vocabulary
and the definitions of a science must be acquired before much
use can be made of the higher discipline to be derived from
scientific study. In language study this higher training comes
from practice in making the minute analysis, in detecting the
fine shades of meaning expressed in the literature itself. So it
is important in selecting a science to be used as a disciplinary
study that the facts and laws of nature with which it is concerned
should be capable of clear and precise definition, and, moreover,
that it should furnish a field for the study of the minute and
intricate relationship existing between the different facts which
are to be attained by personal inspection of the objects themselves.
In most of the sciences this deeper exercise of scientific
thought requires for its successful pursuit artificial aids to the
common senses of observation. Chemistry must have its purified
acids and reagents, test tubes, and delicate scales for
measurement of weight and volume. Mineralogy must have its
chemical analyses, or optical measurements so fine that microscopes
of highest power are essential tools for the investigation.
Physics must have the most delicate measurements of time
and space and weight. Botany, for the earlier stages of study,
is fully equal to geology in these respects, but its scope is much
less general. Zoölogy requires dissections calling for skill in
manipulation, and in other respects is ill adapted to general
classes. But precision in the intellectual processes of observation
and reasoning can be cultivated in the use of geological
facts to their highest and widest perfection, with scarcely any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">« 45 »</a></span>
aids to the normal faculties of observation. A couple of
hammers, a pocket lens, a chisel and a few pointed steel
tools for revealing fossils, a tape line, compass and clinometer
are the few equipments that will enable the geologist to carry
his investigations to almost any degree of thoroughness.</p>

<p>What has already been said applies to the study of the pure
science of geology either in the field or in the laboratory. There
is still another use to which this, as other sciences, may be put
in disciplining the college student in directions not provided
for by literary or mathematical studies,&mdash;the study of man as an
investigator. In the pursuit of the study of geology, the first
instruction must be received in didactic form, but after the text-book
and lecture stage is passed, or while it is under way consultation
of the literature of the sciences is appropriate. In the
use of scientific literature the critical judgment is brought under
training, and the varying interpretations of well known phenomena
by expert scientists suggest the prominent part which
the notions already in the mind play in the interpretation of the
external facts observed. The experienced geologist will recall
many cases of honest report of impossible facts by men who are
unable to distinguish between what they saw and the false interpretations
they made of these observations. One man will
report that a live toad jumped out of the middle of a solid
piece of coal, when it was heated in the stove; another will
swear that he saw a fossil shark's tooth taken out of a ledge
of Trenton limestone. It is evident that our memory of
observation is not the revival of the object producing the
sensation, but of the idea we framed of the sensation at the time.
The study of original descriptions of objects of nature reveals
the fact that the describer uses the ideas he already has in his
mind as he does the standard foot-rule in his hand for measuring
that which he describes, and it is by the study of scientific
literature and the comparison of views of many scientists that
this highest discipline of the observational faculties is attained&mdash;the
power to determine the personal equation of error for the
observer, and thus see through his descriptions a truer representation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">« 46 »</a></span>
of the facts than the observer himself saw. Geological
literature is admirably adapted for this higher discipline, and in
no field of science (I think not in astronomy itself), has wider
and more comprehensive thought been applied than in geology.
While other branches of science have been developed and
become more narrow and special in their treatment of the facts
concerned, geology still stands as the most comprehensive of
all the sciences of nature.</p>

<h2><a name="NATURE_OF_ENGLACIAL_DRIFT" id="NATURE_OF_ENGLACIAL_DRIFT">THE NATURE OF THE ENGLACIAL DRIFT
OF THE MISSISSIPPI BASIN.</a></h2>


<p>It is of some importance, both to the practical work of the
field and the theoretical deductions of the study, to determine the
nature and amount of the drift that was carried forward in the
body of the ancient continental glaciers, and brought out on
their terminal slopes and at length deposited at their frontal
edges, and to distinguish it from that which was pushed or
dragged or rolled along at the bottom of the ice.<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> It may be
helpful to indulge in a speculative discussion at the outset to
prepare the way for the specific evidence and the inferences to
which it leads.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_10" id="Footnote_10"></a><a href="#FNanchor_10"><span class="label">[10]</span></a> Debris, which may be imbedded in the basal layer of the ice during some part
of its transportation, but which is brought down to the bottom and subjected to basal
action in the latter part of its course, and ultimately becomes a part of the basal
deposit, is not here included in the englacial drift.</p></div>

<p>Whenever a prominence of rock is overridden and enveloped
by a glacier of the free-moving continental type, one of two
things takes place; either that part of the ice which passes over
the summit of the prominence flows down its lee slope, carrying
whatever debris it dislodges down to the rear base, and thence
onward along the bottom of the ice, or else the currents which
pass on either side of the prominence close in behind it before
the corresponding current which passes over the summit reaches
the point of their junction, in which case the summit current is
forced to pass off more nearly horizontally into the body of the
ice, carrying with it whatsoever debris it has dislodged from the
summit of the prominence and embodied within its base. The
law of the phenomena appears to be that whenever the height
of the prominence is less than one-half the base, measured transversely
to the movement of the ice, the summit current will follow
down the lee slope; but whenever the height of the prominence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">« 48 »</a></span>
is more than one-half the transverse base, the lateral
currents will close in on the lee, and the summit current will flow
off into the body of the ice. This simple law is, however, subject
to very considerable modifications from several different sources
which may be grouped under (1) differences in the friction
arising from basal contact, and (2) differences of internal friction
and mobility. The lateral currents will expose more surface
to the sides and base of the hill and the adjoining plain, and
will be more subject to conflicting currents, while, on the other
hand, being deeper currents, they will presumably be more fluent.
These and other qualifying conditions will go far to vitiate the
application of the law, but its statement may have some value
as representing a general conception of the phenomena. When
the height of the prominence becomes great relative to the total
thickness of the ice, the fluency of the summit current may be
much reduced relative to that of the central parts of the lateral
currents. When the prominence reaches the surface, blocks
dislodged from it are borne away on the surface of the glacier,
and constitute superglacial drift. Blocks dislodged from near
the summit, but below the surface of the ice, are presumably
carried onward in the upper zone of the glacier; while other
blocks detached at various but sufficient heights on the side of
the prominence are doubtless borne around into the lee and carried
forward in the same vertical plane as the summit stream, so
that there comes to be a vertical zone set with boulders moving
on from the lee side of the nunatak.</p>

<p>Lofty ledges or plateaus, with vertical or undercut faces,
furnish similar means for the lodgment of debris within the
body of the ice.</p>

<p>In these and doubtless in other ways it appears that there
came to be lodged directly within the body of the Pleistocene
glaciers at some considerable distances above their bases, blocks
derived from rock prominences that rose with sufficient steepness
above the general surface of the country over which the ice
passed. The lodgment of debris on the lateral borders of glaciers
is neglected here because it has little or no applicability to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">« 49 »</a></span>
the phenomena of the upper Mississippi basin. It is also doubtful
whether any prominences protruded through the ice except
near the thin edge, when advancing and retreating, and these
are too inconsiderable to merit attention.</p>

<p>It is obvious, upon consideration, that blocks detached from
summits or from the sharp angles of out-jutting ledges or
plateaus might suffer some glacial abrasion in the process of
their dislodgment and transposition along the crest or projecting
angle, but that in general such abrasion would be small, and, in
most cases, nearly or quite absent. The debris so incorporated
in the body of the ice would be, for the most part, angular,
and, as it was brought forward in the ice, it would probably
suffer very little abrasion. If it continued to move forward in
the plane in which it started, descending only so much as the
bottom wastage of the ice required, it would be brought out to
the terminal slope of the ice sheet by virtue of the melting
away of the ice above, and thence it would be carried on down
the terminal slope as superglacial debris, and dropped at the
frontal edge. If this be the true and full history, there would
be no commingling of this englacial matter with the subglacial
debris. It is evident, that the englacial matter brought forward
from the crest of one prominence would be intermingled with
that brought forward from other prominences lying in a line
with it, or lying so near it that the lateral spreading of the
debris would lead to commingling. It is also clear that variations
in the direction of currents would tend to the same result,
so that englacial matter from different prominences of the same
general region might be commingled. So also englacial material,
by crevassing and by the descent of streams from the surface to
the base, would be carried down to the bottom and mingled
with the subglacial debris. So also blocks broken away from
the base of the prominence which yielded the englacial erratics
might be moved forward along the bottom parallel with the
englacial material above, and lodged at any point along the line.
It is therefore to be expected that the basal deposits will contain
the same rock species as the englacial, but if there be no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">« 50 »</a></span>
process by which the basal material is carried upward the reverse
will not be the case, and there will be a clear distinction between
the englacial deposit and the subglacial deposit, in composition
as well as physical state.</p>

<p>Not a few glacialists, however, advocate in somewhat differing
forms and phases the doctrine that basal material is carried
upward into the body of the glacier and at length reaches the
surface, and that at the extremity of the ice this is commingled
with any erratics that may be englacial or superglacial by original
derivation. This doctrine appears to have had its origin in the
endeavor to explain the very common fact that glacial drift has
been carried from lower to higher altitudes. Erratics are often
found lodged several hundred feet higher than the outcrop from
which they were derived. It has never seemed to me, however,
that this phenomenon necessarily was different in kind from that
which takes place in the bottom of every stream; at least I
have not come in contact with any instances that seemed to
require a different explanation, except those connected with
kames and eskers that require a special explanation in any
case. We are so accustomed to view streams from above, and
so accustomed to study the extinct glaciers from the bottom,
that we are liable to overlook the community of some of the
simpler processes involved alike in both phenomena. The
dictum that water never runs up hill is measurably true of the
surface currents of the ice as well as water, but it altogether
fails when applied to the basal currents of either. It is probable
that there is no natural stream of any length in which, at some
part of its course, basal debris is not carried from lower to
higher altitudes and lodged there. If the bed of any stream
were made dry and the debris in it critically examined, it would
be found that at numerous points the silts or sands or gravels
had been carried from the bottom of some basin in its bed to
the higher rim or bar or reef that bordered it on the downstream
side. So I conceive that, on a grander scale, the natural
result of the flow of the basal ice of a continental glacier over
the inequalities of the country was the lifting of material from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">« 51 »</a></span>
some of the lower horizons and its lodgment on the crests of
ridges or the slopes or summits of mountains that lay athwart
its course.</p>

<p>So again, it is certain that a considerable part of the peripheral
drainage of glaciers takes place through tunnels beneath
the ice. It is reasonable to suppose that during the winter
season, when the drainage is slack, these tunnels tend to collapse
in greater or less degree, under the continued pressure of the
ice and the "fattening" of the glacier, so that in the early part
of the next melting season the contracted tunnels may be over-flooded
by glacial waters. To the extent that these tunnels
become incompetent the water would become ponded back in
the crevasses and moulins by which the surface-water gains
access to them. They thus come to have something of the
force of water flowing in tubes, and may be presumed to be
capable of forcing rounded material to some considerable
height, and of carrying ice-imbedded boulders to any point
reached by the stream. These tunnels probably undulate with
the bottom, and lodgment along them takes place wherever
enlargement permits.</p>

<p>Without, therefore, appealing to any upward cross currents
within the ice itself, it is possible to explain the transportation
of the drift from lower to higher altitudes. I have never seen
phenomena of this kind that seemed to call for any other explanation
than these. I am not prepared to say that there are no
such phenomena. One of the purposes of this article will have
been accomplished, if it shall call forth a critical statement of
phenomena that require the assumption of internal upward
movements of the ice to account for them, and of the criteria
which distinguish such phenomena from those that may be
referred to upward basal movements such as are common to all
streams or to the exceptionally conditioned subglacial streams.
That there are upward internal movements in most streams is as
much beyond question as the existence of upward basal currents
in rivers and glaciers, but they are dependent chiefly upon the
velocity of the current and the irregularity of the bottom.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">« 52 »</a></span>
Theoretically, as I understand, a stream moving in a straight
course on a perfectly smooth bottom would not develop an
upward cross current. Each lower layer would move slower
than that above it by reason of basal friction, but they would
move on in parallel lines. But if irregularity of bottom be
introduced the parallelism is obviously destroyed, and if the
velocity be high so that the momentum of the particles becomes
great relative to their cohesion, irregular internal movements
will result, and these will often be of a rotary nature in vertical
planes bringing the basal parts of the fluid to the surface or the
reverse. For this reason rapid streams abound in rotary currents,
while slow streams do not.</p>

<p>Now it is quite obvious that a stream of water moving at a
rate of three or four feet per day, or even fifty or sixty feet per
day, would not develop perceptible upward currents, and certainly
would not lift the lightest silt from its bottom. I do not think
there are any theoretical grounds for believing that internal
glacial currents are developed, which flow from base to surface,
carrying bottom debris to the top.</p>

<p>One of the most remarkable expressions of the drift
phenomena of the Upper Mississippi region consists of belts of
boulders stretching for great distances over the face of the
country, and disposing themselves in great loops after the
fashion of the terminal moraines of the region with which they
are intimately connected. Besides this, there are numerous
patches of boulders of more or less irregular form and uncertain
relations. The whole of these have not been studied in detail,
but a sufficient portion of them have received careful examination
to justify the drawing of certain conclusions from them.
Those which have been most studied lie in Ohio, Indiana,
Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin, Iowa and Dakota. Those of the
first three States have been most carefully traced and their constitution
is such as to give them the greatest discriminative
value. To these our discussion will be limited chiefly.<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>Emerging from the dunes at a point north of the Iroquois
river in Jasper county, northwestern Indiana, a well characterized
belt of surface boulders stretches westward to the State line, just
beyond which it curves about to the south and then to the east,
and re-enters Indiana a little south of the northwest corner of
Benton county. It soon turns abruptly to the south and reaches
the Wabash river near the centre of Warren county. The immediate
valley of the Wabash is thickly strewn with boulders
from the point where the belt reaches it to the vicinity of West
Point on the western line of Tippecanoe county. The uplands,
however, do not give any clear indication of the continuity
of the belt, and the connection is not altogether certain.
There is an inner well-marked belt that branches away from
this in the central part of Benton county and runs southeasterly
into the northwestern quarter of Tippecanoe county, beyond
which only scattered boulders occur, which leaves its precise
connections also in doubt. But starting from West Point, which
is less than a dozen miles from the point where the two belts
cease to be traceable with certainty, a well-defined belt, one or
two miles wide, runs southeasterly across the southwestern corner
of Tippecanoe county and the northeastern quarter of Montgomery
county to the vicinity of Darlington, beyond which its
connection is again obscure, although boulders occur frequently
between this point and the northwestern corner of Brown
county, where boulders are very abundant. So also, patches of
exceptionally abundant boulders occur in the west central part
of Clinton county. These may be entitled to be regarded as a
connecting link between the train which enters northwestern
Tippecanoe county and that of northwestern Boone county, as
scattered boulders of the surface type, but of not very exceptionally
frequent occurrence, lie between them. However this
may be, a belt of much more than usually frequent surface
boulders stretches southeasterly to the vicinity of Indianapolis,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">« 54 »</a></span>
and probably connects with a very well-marked belt lying near
the south line of the southeast quarter of Marion county and in
the northeastern part of Johnson county. There is also a well-defined
tract in southeastern Hendricks county, running east and
west, without evident connection with the foregoing tracts,
though it may be the equivalent of the Darlington belt. There
is also a somewhat unusual aggregation in the form of irregular
belts in southeastern Johnson county, in the vicinity of Nineveh,
and in southern Shelby county. The belt south of Indianapolis
is probably to be correlated by scattered boulders only slightly
more abundant than those of the adjacent region, but of the
surface type, stretching northeasterly to near the center of the
west half of Henry county, where a well-marked belt again sets
in. From this point the tract runs northeasterly nearly to the
north limit of the county, where it turns easterly and runs in the
vicinity of the line between Randolph and Wayne counties to
near the Ohio line, where it curves to the southeast entering
Ohio near the northwest corner of Preble county. In its southeasterly
course across that county it is phenomenally developed
as has been well shown by the descriptions of Professor Orton.
Soon after entering Montgomery county it curves about to a
northeasterly course, and crossing the great Miami river, a few
miles above Dayton, holds its northeast course across the southeastern
part of Miami county, the northwestern part of Champaign
county, and thence on to about the center of Logan
county, where it curves about and runs in a direction a little east
of south to near the southeast corner of Champaign county,
beyond which it ceases to be a specially notable phenomenon.</p>

<p>In the region between the Wabash and Kankakee rivers, in
northern Indiana, there are numerous tracts of irregular form
over which surface boulders in phenomenal abundance are
scattered. These are particularly noticeable in southern Jasper
county; in the vicinity of Wolcott, Monon and Chalmers in
White county; near Star City in Pulaski county; in the southeastern
corner of Stark county, and very generally along the
great interlobate moraines, lying parallel with the Eel river,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">« 55 »</a></span>
and some others of the Saginaw glacial lobe. These are so
associated with the inter-tangled morainic phenomena of that
region as not to admit of convenient and brief description in
their genetic relationships.</p>

<p>The well-defined tracts have a most significant distribution.
The first part described is associated with the terminal moraine
that marked the margin of a lobe of ice that moved westward
along the axis of the Iroquois basin to a point a few miles beyond
the Indiana-Illinois line. The portion that runs southward to
the Wabash is associated with the moraine that follows the same
course, and runs at right angles over the older moraines of the
Lake Michigan lobe. The tract in Tippecanoe and Montgomery
counties, that in south Marion county, and that in Henry and Randolph
counties, in the eastern part of the state, are associated
with the terminal moraines that form a broad loop with the West
White river basin lying in its axis. In western Ohio the belt is
intimately associated with a moraine that bordered the Miami
lobe of the ice sheet, and the south-trending portion in eastern
Logan and Champaign counties lies on the western margin of
the Scioto lobe.</p>

<p>The relationship of these tracts to terminal moraines is very
clear and specific. They constitute marginal phenomena of the
ancient ice sheet. Their distribution completely excludes their
reference to floating ice, for they not only undulate over the
surface utterly negligent of any horizontal distribution, but they
are disposed in loops in crossing the basins of the region, and the
convexities of these loops are turned down stream. These basins
for the most part open out in southerly or westerly directions
which makes it improbable that ice-bearing bodies of water occupied
them. But if this were not fatal, certainly the fact that the
convexities of the boulder belts are turned down stream and cross
the centers of the basins is precisely contrary to the distribution
they must have assumed if they were due to floating ice in bodies
of water occupying the basins. I hold it, therefore, to be beyond
rational question that these tracts were deposited as we find
them by the margins of the glacial lobes that invaded the region.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">« 56 »</a></span></p>

<p>If these boulder belts were of the same nature as the average
boulders of the till-sheets beneath them, then the simple fact of
unusual aggregation might be plausibly referred to the accidents
of gathering and deposition. But they are very clearly distinguished
from the average boulders of the till by several
characteristics.</p>

<p>1. They are superficial. Sometimes they rest completely on
the surface, sometimes they are very slightly imbedded, sometimes
half buried, sometimes they protrude but a slight portion,
and sometimes they are entirely concealed, but lie immediately
at the surface. In all cases the aggregation is distinctly superficial.
Where they are buried, the burying material is usually of
different texture and composition from the subjacent till, and
appears to be distinct in origin from it. The superficiality of the
tract is very obvious almost everywhere, and is especially so in
regions where the subjacent till is of the pebble-clay rather
than boulder-clay order, for the comparative absence of boulders
below emphasizes the contrast. Throughout most of the
region the subjacent till is not of a very bouldery type, so that
the distinction is generally a marked one.</p>

<p>2. The boulders of the belts are almost without exception
derivatives from the crystalline terranes of Canada. Those of
the great tract especially under consideration were derived from
the typical Huronian rocks of the region north of Lake Huron,
and from granitic and gneissoid rocks referable to the Laurentian
series of the same region. These last, however, cannot be
sharply distinguished from the granitic rocks derived from
other parts of the Laurentian terrane. The Huronian rocks are
very easily identified because of the peculiarities of some of the
species. Among these the one most conspicuously characterized
is a quartz-and-jasper conglomerate. The matrix is usually a
whitish quartzite. This is studded with pebbles of typical red
jasper and of duller rocks of jasperoid nature, which grade
thence into typical quartzite pebbles. With these are mingled
crystalline pebbles of other varieties. Another peculiar erratic
comes from the "slate conglomerate" of Logan. It consists of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">« 57 »</a></span>
a slaty matrix through which are scattered rather distantly
pebbles of granitic, quartzitic and other crystalline rocks. This
is one of the forms of the "basal conglomerate" of Irving.
Other varieties of this "basal conglomerate" are present. In
addition to these very peculiar rocks, a quartzite of a very light
greenish semi-translucent hue has a wide distribution along the
tract. It is readily distinguishable from the numerous other
quartzites of the drift of the interior. Some years since, on
returning from my first field examination of a portion of this
belt, I sent a typical series of chips from the characteristic
erratics to Professor Irving, who had recently returned from
the study of the original Huronian region. He returned a suite
of chippings that matched them perfectly throughout, all of
which were taken <i>in situ</i> in the region north of Lake Huron.</p>

<p>Among the boulders of the belt are occasionally found specimens
of impure limestone or of limy sandstone that might perhaps
be referred doubtfully to some member of the paleozoic
series; but on the other hand, might with equal or greater probability
perhaps be referred to the similar rocks of the Huronian
series. These are quite rare, never forming, so far as my
observations go, as much as one per cent. of the series.
In the several definite enumerations made to determine
the percentage of the doubtful specimens, the result never
exceeded a fraction of one per cent. In the most extensive
enumeration the result was about one-half of one per cent.
Aside from these doubtful specimens there are practically no
boulders in the belts that can be referred to any of the paleozoic
rocks that intervene in the 500 miles between the parent
series north of Lake Huron and the tract over which the boulders
are now strewn. Occasionally there may be seen erratics
from the paleozoic series at or near the surface, but they are not
usually so disposed on the surface as to appear to be true members
of the superficial boulder tract. There is, therefore, the
amplest ground for the assertion that these boulder tracts are of
distant derivation, and that they are essentially uncommingled
with derivatives from the intermediate region.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">« 58 »</a></span></p>

<p>3. The boulders of this series are much more angular than
those of the typical till sheets. Some of them, indeed, are
rounded, but the rounding is generally of the type which boulders
derived by surface degradation and exfoliation present.
They rarely have the forms that are distinctively glacial. Quite
a large percentage are notably angular, and have neither suffered
glacial rounding nor spherical exfoliation. Some few are glacially
worn and scratched, but the percentage of these is
small.</p>

<p>The tracts therefore present these four salient characteristics:
(1) the boulders are derived from distant crystalline
terranes (400 to 500 miles) and are essentially uncommingled
with rock from the intervening paleozoic terranes; (2) they are
essentially superficial, and the associated earthy material has a
texture differing from that of the subglacial tills; (3) they are
notably angular and free from glacial abrasion, except in minor
degree; (4) the tracts are so associated with terminal moraines
and so related to the topography of the region, that there is no
rational ground for doubt that the boulders were borne to their
present places by the glaciers that produced the correlative
moraines.</p>

<p>In contrast to these superficial boulder formations, the till
sheets below are made up of a very large percentage of glacial
clay whose constitution shows that it was produced in part by
the grinding down of the paleozoic series. In this are imbedded
boulders and pebbles that were derived from the paleozoic series
as indicated by their petrological character, and, in many
instances, demonstrated by contained fossils. While a small
part of the boulders contained in the till are angular or but
slightly worn, the larger part are blunted, bruised, scratched and
polished by typical glacial action. This obvious grinding of the
boulders, taken in connection with the clay product resulting
from the grinding, affords a clear demonstration that the deposit
was produced at the base of the ice by its pushing, dragging,
rolling action.</p>

<p>The two formations, therefore, stand in sharp contrast; the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">« 59 »</a></span>
one indicating the passive transporting action of the ice in
bearing from their distant homes north of the lakes the crystalline
boulders and dropping them quietly on the surface, the
other indicating the active dynamic function of the ice in
rubbing, bruising and scoring the material at its base. The one
seems to me a clear instance of englacial and superglacial transportation;
the other an equally clear example of subglacial
push, drag and kneading.</p>

<p>Now if it were the habit of an ice-sheet of this kind to carry
material from its bottom to the surface by internal movement, it
would seem that the distance of 400 to 500 miles which intervened
between the source of the crystallines and the place of their
deposit would have furnished ample opportunity for its exercise,
and that there would have been commingled with the englacial
and superglacial material many derivatives from the intermediate
region, and these derivatives should have borne the characteristic
markings received by them while at the base of the ice. The
very conspicuous absence of such commingling, and the absence
or phenomenal rarity of anything that even looks like such a
commingling, appears to me to testify in quite unmistakable
terms to the distinctness of the methods of transportation. In
view of the great territory over which this particular belt is
spread, and the greater territory which is embraced in the other
tracts not here specially considered, there is left little ground
for doubt that this distinctness of englacial from basal transportation
was a prevailing fact and not an exceptional one. This
is supported by concurrent evidence derived from the territory
west of Lake Michigan. This territory unfortunately does not bear
erratics that have equally distinct characteristics, but, so far as my
observation goes, the phenomena are alike throughout. I am therefore
brought to the conclusion that, in the interior at least, there
was no habitual lifting of boulders from the base of the ice sheets
to the surface, nor any habitual commingling of basal with englacial
and superglacial material, except, of course, as it took place by
virtue of the falling of the latter through crevasses to the base,
and by mechanical intermixture of the two at the edge of the ice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">« 60 »</a></span></p>

<p>The amount of englacial till under this view is little more
than that which was lodged in the body of the ice in its passage
over the knobs and ridges of the hilly and semi-mountainous
regions of the north. To this is perhaps to be added occasional
derivatives from the more abrupt prominences of the paleozoic
region and the superficial dust blown upon the ice from the
surrounding land, which was probably the chief source of the
silty material intermingled with the superficial boulders. The
total amount is thus quite small, though important in its significance.</p>

<p>The eskers and kames of the region are made up of derivatives
from the basal material as shown by (1) the local origin of
the material in large part, (2) the mechanical origin of the
sands and silts, (3) the not infrequent glacial markings of the
pebbles and boulders, and (4) the disturbed stratification of the
beds.<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> If I am correct in respect to the kind and amount of
the englacial and superglacial material, it is obvious that eskers
and kames, such as are found in the interior, could not be derived
from englacial or superglacial sources. The term englacial as
here used does not include such materials as may be lodged in
the basal stratum of the ice and brought down to the actual
bottom by basal melting.</p>

<h3>I. <span class="smcap">Introduction.</span></h3>

<p>It has long been evident that writers on glacial geology are
not at one concerning some of the important questions which
underlie the interpretation of the history of the glacial period.
Certain recent publications have served to emphasize the differences
between them. There are two questions, at least, concerning
which there must be agreement, or at any rate a common
understanding, before existing differences can be eliminated or
justly evaluated. When the answers to these questions have
been agreed upon, or when the positions of the contending parties
are clearly understood, it may be found that some of the
apparent antagonisms have no better basis than differences in
definition. Stated interrogatively, the two questions referred to
are these: 1. What constitutes a glacial epoch as distinct from
other glacial epochs? and 2. What are the criteria for the recognition
of distinct glacial epochs, if such there were?</p>


<h3>II. <span class="smcap">The Idea of a Glacial Epoch.</span></h3>

<p>It is conceivable that, after the development and extension
of a continental ice-sheet, it might be wholly wasted away.
The maximum extension of such an ice-sheet would mark the
culmination of a glacial epoch. If subsequently another ice-sheet
of considerable dimensions were accumulated, its development
and extension would constitute a second glacial epoch.
These successive ice-sheets might be so related to each other in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">« 62 »</a></span>
time, in position, and in the sequence of geological events, as to
be regarded as separate epochs of the same glacial period.<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> On
the other hand they might be so widely separated from each
other in time, in position, and in the sequence of geological
events, as to make their reference to separate glacial periods
more appropriate. In any case their separation would be sufficiently
marked to necessitate their reference to separate ice
epochs. So far we believe there would be no disagreement.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_14" id="Footnote_14"></a><a href="#FNanchor_14"><span class="label">[14]</span></a> The terms period and epoch are here used in the sense in which they have been
used most commonly in the literature of glacial geology in the United States.</p></div>

<p>If, instead of entirely disappearing, the first ice-sheet suffered
great reduction of volume and area, and if this reduction were
followed by a second great expansion of the ice, might the time
of such expansion be regarded as a second glacial epoch of the
common glacial period? To this question, too, as thus stated,
we apprehend there would be but one answer, and that affirmative.</p>

<p>It seems certain that the edge of the continental ice-sheet
was subject to more or less extensive oscillations, as are the ends
of glaciers and the edges of ice-sheets to-day. How much of
an oscillation is necessary, and under what attendant conditions
must it take place, in order that the recession of the ice-edge
shall mark an interglacial and its re-advance a distinct glacial
epoch? When the question takes this specific form, and when
inquiry is made concerning the quantitative value of the different
elements entering into the problem, we reach the battled
ground. It is the battled ground, partly because it is the ground
of misunderstanding. It is the ground of misunderstanding,
partly because glacialists are not agreed as to the meaning of
certain terms in common use by them.</p>

<p>Four elements seem to enter into the idea of an ice epoch
as distinct from other ice epochs. These are (1) the distance to
which the ice retreated between successive advances; (2) the
duration of the retreat, or the time which elapsed between successive
ice extensions; (3) the temperature of the region freed
from ice during the time between maxima of advance; and (4)
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">« 63 »</a></span>
the intervention between successive advances, of changes interrupting
the continuity of geological processes.</p>

<p>(1.) It would be arbitrary to name any definite distance to
which the ice must recede in order to constitute its re-advance
a distinct ice epoch. It would be not so much a question of
miles as a question of proportions. Considering this point alone,
we presume it would be agreed that an ice-sheet should have
suffered the loss of a very considerable proportion of its mass,
and that it should have dwindled to proportions very much less
than those subsequently attained, before its re-advance could
properly be called a separate glacial epoch. To be specific, if
the North American ice-sheet, after its maximum extension,
retreated so far as to free the whole of the United States from
ice, we should be inclined to regard a re-advance as marking a
distinct ice epoch of the same glacial period, if in such re-advance
the ice reached an extension comparable with that of the earlier
ice-sheet. Especially should we be inclined to refer the second
ice advance to a second glacial epoch, if it, as well as the preceding
retreat, were accompanied by favoring phases of some or all
the other three elements entering into the notion of a glacial epoch.
In this statement we do not overlook the fact that a northerly
region&mdash;as Labrador or Greenland&mdash;might be continuously covered
with ice throughout the time of the two glaciations of the
more southerly regions. But this is not regarded as a sufficient
reason for discarding the notion of duality. Greenland has very
likely been experiencing continuous glaciation since a time
antedating that of our first glacial deposits. The renewal to-day
of glaciation comparable in extent to that of the glacial period
would certainly be regarded as a distinct glacial epoch, if not a
distinct glacial period, even though Greenland's glaciation may
not have been interrupted. Scandinavia and Switzerland have
probably not been freed from ice since the glacial period. Their
snow and ice fields are probably the direct descendants of the
ice fields of the glacial period. An expansion of the existing
bodies of ice in these countries to their former dimensions, would
constitute a new glacial epoch, if not a new glacial period.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">« 64 »</a></span>
Analogous subdivisions in pre-Pleistocene formations have been
frequently recognized.</p>

<p>(2) The application of the time element is hardly susceptible
of quantitative statement. We are inclined to think that
it would be generally agreed that, with a given amount of recession
of the ice, its re-advance would be more properly regarded
as a distinct glacial epoch if the interval which had elapsed
since the first advance were long. Whether a longer time
between the separate advances might reduce the amount of
recession necessary in order to constitute the second advance a
second epoch, we are not prepared to assert; but we are inclined
to think it might.</p>

<p>(3) The third element is perhaps somewhat more tangible
than the second. If, during the retreat of the ice, the climate of a
region which was twice glaciated became as temperate as that of
the present day in the same locality, we should be inclined to
regard the preceding and succeeding glaciations as distinct ice
epochs, especially if the intervening recession were great and its
duration long.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for simplicity and ease of determination, there
are difficulties in determining with precision how far the ice
retreated between successive maxima of advance, how long the
interval during which it remained in retreat, and the extent to
which the climate was ameliorated, as compared with that which
went before and that which followed.</p>

<p>(4) If changes of any sort which interrupt the continuity
of geological processes intervened between successive maxima
of advance of the ice, the separation of the later advance
from the earlier, as a distinct ice epoch, would be favored.
How great the intervening changes should be in order to
constitute the re-advance a distinct ice epoch, is a point
concerning which there might be difference of opinion. But it
is altogether possible that such changes might intervene as alone
to give sufficient basis for the separation. Orographic movements,
resulting either in continental changes of altitude or attitude are
among the events which might come in to separate one ice
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">« 65 »</a></span>
epoch from another. Changes of this sort have often furnished
the basis for the major and minor divisions of time in other
parts of geological history, so that there can be no question as
to their adequacy, if they were of sufficient magnitude. We
hold that the intervention of orographic or other important geologic
changes might reduce to a minimum the amount of recession,
the duration of the recession, and the warmth of the intervening
climate necessary to constitute the separate ice advances
separate ice epochs. The absence of great orographic or other
changes in glaciated regions between successive advances of
the ice would be no proof that such advances should not be
regarded as separate epochs. Divisions of equal importance
have often been made without evidence of such changes.</p>

<p>From the foregoing discussion, brief as it is, it will be seen
that within certain narrow limits the definition of a glacial
epoch, as distinct from other glacial epochs, must be more or
less arbitrary. It is less important that an arbitrary definition
should be accepted, than that the same meaning should be
attached to technical terms in common use among geologists.
In the interest of harmony and of a common understanding,
and without the violation of any truth of science, we believe it
would be well if the conception of a glacial epoch, as framed by
those who are our leaders in position and in fact, were made the
basis for our usage of the term.</p>


<h3>III. <span class="smcap">The Criteria of Distinct Glacial Epochs.</span></h3>

<p>If there have been differences of opinion concerning the
nature of ice epochs, as distinct from each other and from ice
periods, there has been a failure to adequately apprehend the
nature, the extent, and the meaning of the real criteria on which
the final recognition of separate ice epochs, if such there were,
must be based.</p>

<p>Such criteria are several in number. They are of unequal
value. In some instances a single one of them might be quite
sufficient to establish the fact of two ice epochs. In other
cases, single criteria which might not be in themselves demonstrative,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">« 66 »</a></span>
have great corroborative weight, when found in association
with others. In all cases, much discretion must be used in the
interpretation of these criteria. They may be enumerated under
several specific heads.</p>

<p>(1) <i>Forest Beds.</i> Beds of vegetal deposits or old soils are
frequently found between layers of glacial drift. This is one of
the criteria most commonly cited, because it is of common occurrence
and easy of recognition. The advocates of the unity of
the glacial period maintain that such beds of organic matter
might become interbedded with morainic debris during minor
oscillations of the ice's edge. The phenomena of existing glaciers
make it evident that forest beds or soils might be enclosed
by the deposits of an oscillating ice edge. By repeated oscillations
of the ice's edge during the general retreat of the ice, such
vegetal beds might become interstratified with glacial drift more
or less frequently over all the area once covered by the ice, and
from which it has now disappeared. The mere presence of vegetable
material between beds of drift is therefore no proof of distinct
ice epochs. This does not destroy the value of the vegetal
beds as a criterion for the recognition of distinct ice epochs,
but it makes caution necessary in its application. It does not
follow that, since <i>some</i> inter-drift forest-beds do not prove interglacial
epochs, <i>none</i> do. The question is not how forest-beds
might originate, but how existing forest-beds did originate.</p>

<p>Where the plant-remains found in the relations indicated are
so well preserved as to make identification of the species possible,
we have a means of determining, with some degree of
accuracy, the climatic conditions which must have obtained at the
place where the plants grew during the time of their life. If
these interbedded plant-remains are of such a character as to
indicate a temperate climate, we can not suppose that they grew
at the immediate edge of the ice, and therefore that they were
buried beneath its oscillating margin. To be specific, if the
inter-drift plant remains in any given locality of the area once
covered by ice are such as to indicate a climate <i>as warm as the
present in the same locality</i>, the ice must have receded so far to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">« 67 »</a></span>
the northward that its re-advance might, in our judgment, appropriately
be regarded as a separate ice epoch.</p>

<p>It has been suggested in opposition that temperate conditions
may obtain even up to the edge of the ice, and that interbedded
vegetal remains indicating temperate climate do not
prove any considerable recession of the ice. The phenomena
about existing glaciers have been appealed to in support of this
demurrer. But the objection is not well taken. The climatic
conditions which obtain about the borders of small, local glaciers,
are not a safe guide as to climatic conditions which obtained
about the margin of a continental ice-sheet, any more than the
climatic conditions which obtain about a small inland lake are
a safe criterion as to the climatic conditions about a sea-coast.
The general principles of climatology, as well as specific facts concerning
plant distribution, seem to us to indicate that the climate
about the border of a continental ice-sheet must have been arctic.</p>

<p>It is evident that the greater the distance north of the overlying
drift remains of temperate plants are found, the more conclusive
becomes the evidence. Plant remains indicating temperate
climate at the very margin of the drift sheet which overlies
them, would be less conclusive than similar evidences one
hundred miles to the northward. It might be difficult to prove
in any given instance that the ice which deposited the drift overlying
plant remains advanced one hundred miles, or any other
specific distance, south of any particular underlying forest bed.
If the forest bed were continuous for the whole distance, the
case would be clear. It would also be conclusive if the continuity
of the drift overlying a forest bed at any point with that
of a remote point to the south, could be demonstrated. In spite
of these difficulties in its application, the vegetal beds constitute
a valuable criterion in making the discriminations under consideration,
when they are properly applied. Under proper circumstances
the criterion may be conclusive when taken alone, and it
may have corroborative significance when not itself conclusive.</p>

<p>The absence of forest beds and of all traces of vegetal deposits
whatsoever between beds of drift, is no proof of the absence of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">« 68 »</a></span>
recurrent ice epochs, since the second advance of the ice might
have destroyed all trace of the preëxistent soil and its vegetal
life. It is always possible, too, that such beds exist, even if they
have not been discovered. It would have been anticipated
that they would not be abundant, or wide spread. The absence
of forest beds is therefore at best no more than negative
evidence.</p>

<p>(2) <i>Remains of Land Animals.</i> Bones of mammalia or
remains of other land animals, occurring in relations similar to
those in which forest beds occur, may have a like significance.
Their value as a criterion of separate glacial epochs is subject
to essentially the same limitations as forest beds.</p>

<p>(3) <i>Inorganic Products formed during a time of Ice Recession.</i>
The recession of the ice after a maximum of advance would
leave a land surface more or less affected with marshes and
ponds. In such situations, bog iron ore might accumulate, if
conditions were favorable. Such ore beds, buried by the drift of
a later ice advance, would have a significance comparable to that
of forest beds, except that they would give less definite information
as to climate, and would be correspondingly less trustworthy.
Should such ore beds be found in such relations as to prove that
the underlying and overlying bodies of drift were deposited by ice
sheets which extended great distances further south, their significance
would be enhanced. From the thickness of the ore beds
some inference might be drawn as to the length of time concerned
in their accumulation. But because of the variable rate
at which bog ore may accumulate, such inference should be
used with caution.</p>

<p>Concretions of iron oxide might be formed in the marshes or
in ill-drained drift areas where accumulations of greater extent
were not made. A subsequent incursion of the ice might incorporate
these nodules with its drift, wearing and striating them
as other stones, and depositing them as constituent parts of the
later drift. Such iron nodules in the later drift would mean a
recession and re-advance of the ice with some considerable interval
between, although not necessarily an interval sufficiently
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">« 69 »</a></span>
warm or long to be regarded as an interglacial epoch.<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> Calcareous
concretions, like those of the loess, would possess a like
significance, in like relations. While in themselves these inorganic
products of a time of ice recession might fail to be conclusive
of separate ice epochs, they might have much corroborative
significance when associated with other phenomena. An
inter-till iron ore bed, associated with a forest bed which indicated
a warm climate, would be most significant.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_15" id="Footnote_15"></a><a href="#FNanchor_15"><span class="label">[15]</span></a> This point concerning iron nodules was suggested to the writer by Mr. W. J.
McGee.</p></div>

<p>The absence of knowledge of ore beds between sheets of till,
and the absence from an upper bed of till of concretions of iron and
lime carbonate formed during a recession of the ice, would be
no proof that interglacial epochs did not occur. These products
were probably formed in relatively few localities. They stood
good chance of destruction at the hands of the returning ice, and
they may exist, where they have not been discovered, or where
their significance has not been understood. Their absence is at
best no more than negative evidence.</p>

<p>(4) <i>Beds of Marine and Lacustrine Origin.</i> If between beds
of glacial drift there be found beds of lacustrine or of marine
origin, such beds would indicate a recession of the ice during
their time of deposition. Their position would be a minimum
measure of ice recession. If such lacustrine beds contain
organic remains, they will bear testimony concerning the climatic
conditions which existed where they occur, at the time of their
deposition. If the fossils in such beds denote a temperate climate,
or a climate as mild as that of the present day in the same
region, the ice must have receded so far to the northward as, in
our judgment, to constitute its re-advance a distinct ice epoch.
This line of argument may be even stronger than that drawn from
remains of terrestrial life, since the ice would probably affect the
temperature of the sea to greater distances than that of the land,
and affect it to a greater degree within a given distance. The
argument becomes stronger the further north the inter-drift
marine and lacustrine deposits occur, since the ice must always
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">« 70 »</a></span>
have receded to a position still further north. If marine or
lacustrine beds lying far north of the later ice limit contain
proof of temperate climate, the argument becomes conclusive.</p>

<p>The absence of marine and lacustrine deposits between beds
of drift, would be no proof that interglacial epochs did not
occur. Lacustrine beds could be made only where there were
lakes, and lakes would be the exception rather than the rule.
Marine beds in similar positions would rarely be known, except
where a definite succession of changes of level has taken place.
Both classes of deposits, if once formed, would be subject to
destruction by the over-riding ice of a later epoch, if such there
were. Neither would be likely to be preserved at all points
where formed, and both may exist at many points where their
existence is not known. The absence of these beds is at best
no more than negative evidence.</p>

<p>(5) <i>Beds of Subaërial Gravel, Sand and Silt.</i> Layers of stratified
drift between layers of ground moraine are of common occurrence
in many regions. Under ordinary conditions their existence is
not regarded as evidence that the underlying and overlying tills
are to be referred to separate ice epochs. But it is conceivable
that beds of stratified drift may, under the proper circumstances
and relations, be strong evidence of separate ice epochs. The
last stages of ice work in the glacial period were accompanied, in
many regions, by the deposition upon adjacent land surfaces, of
extensive bodies of gravel and sand, washed on beyond the ice
by waters issuing from it. Except in valleys through which
strong currents coursed, such deposits were apparently not carried
far beyond the edge of the ice. But as the edge of the ice
withdrew to the northward, sand plains may have extended
themselves in the same direction, by additions to their ice-ward
faces. It is conceivable that the process of subaërial plain
building at the edge of a receding phase of ice, might be
carried so far under favorable circumstances, as to result in the
construction of plains of great extent. In this event, a subsequent
ice-advance might overspread such plains in such wise
as to bury, without destroying them, though such a course of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">« 71 »</a></span>
events would certainly be exceptional. In order to constitute
the interstratified gravel and sand evidence of separate ice-epochs,
its continuity for great distances between beds of till,
and in the direction of ice movement, would need to be demonstrated.
In themselves, these beds, under the conditions
indicated, would simply be a minimum measure of the amount
of ice recession between the deposition of the underlying and
overlying bodies of till. It is hardly likely, though possible,
that the continuity of interbedded gravel and sand could be
proved for a sufficient distance north of the southern limit of
the less extensive bed of ground moraine, to alone constitute
evidence of a recession of ice great enough to make it necessary
to refer its re-advance to a new epoch. Beds of silt in like
relations, deposited by waters beyond the edge of the ice, would
have a like significance so far as the question here under consideration
is concerned. Such beds of stratified drift might sometimes
have corroborative value when their testimony, taken by
itself, is inconclusive. If, for example, their surfaces are marked
by forest beds, and especially by forest beds whose plants denote
a warm climate, the association becomes most significant.</p>

<p>In view of what has been said, it is evident that the absence
of beds of subaërially stratified silt, sand, and gravel, between
beds of till can not be brought in evidence against separate ice
epochs. It would rarely be true that topographic and hydro-*graphic
conditions would make possible the construction of
plains of sufficient extent to serve as criteria for the purpose
here indicated, and few of those formed would escape such a
degree of destruction as to leave them demonstrably continuous.
There is also the further possibility that such beds exist, even
though their continuity be not known. To prove the continuity
of a buried bed of stratified and incoherent drift, even if it
existed, would be a most difficult task.</p>

<p>(6) <i>Differential Weathering.</i> If, after covering a given
region, the ice retreated, the drift which it left in the area which
it previously covered would be subject to oxidation, leaching
and disintegration. The depth to which this oxidation, leaching
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">« 72 »</a></span>
and disintegration would extend, would be dependent upon the
length of time during which the drift was exposed, and upon
the climate which affected the region during its exposure. The
longer the exposure and the warmer the climate, the deeper would
the weathering extend. If, subsequently, the ice extended
over the same region, it might, in some places, override and
bury the old surface without destroying it. The earlier oxidized
and leached drift would thus come to be buried by the newer, unoxidized,
unleached drift. If, therefore, beneath the newer drift
of any given locality there be found a lower drift, the surface of
which is oxidized and leached to a considerable depth, the evidence
is strong that the lower drift was exposed for a long period
of time before the upper drift was deposited upon it. Within
certain limits a similar result might be brought about, it is true,
if the ice, after having reached a certain maximum stage of advance,
were to retreat for a short distance only and there remain
for a very long period of time. A subsequent minor advance
might bury the oxidized surface of the drift beyond the position
of the long ice-halt. Under these conditions, the climate
which would have obtained in the area of the drift exposed during
the minor retreat would have been cold, and oxidation, leaching,
and disintegration would have proceeded slowly. If they reached
considerable depths, the time involved must have been very
long. If this surface of oxidized and leached and disintegrated
drift were found to reach far to the northward beneath the layer
of newer and upper drift, it would indicate a great recession of
the ice. We maintain that if it were found sufficiently far north
of the margin of the overlying drift, and if its depth were sufficiently
great, extending well down below any possible accumulation
of superglacial till, it might be a positive criterion of so great
a recession of the ice, protracted through so great an interval
of time, as to constitute its new advance a separate ice epoch.</p>

<p>There is much reason to believe that the soil developed
under the influence of a warm climate differs in some respects
from one developed from similar material under other conditions.
The well-known fact that red and reddish soils are especially
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">« 73 »</a></span>
characteristic of low latitudes and warm climates is significant.
If therefore a soil developed on the surface of one sheet of drift
and buried by another, be found to possess, in addition to unmistakable
marks of long exposure, the peculiar marks which seem
to be characteristic of soils developed under high temperatures,
the argument gains in strength.</p>

<p>This argument from oxidation and weathering has another
application. If in a later advance, following a protracted recession,
the ice-sheet failed to reach the limit of its earlier advance,
there would remain an area of drift deposited by the first ice-sheet,
outside the drift deposited by the later. Now if the time
interval between these two advances was great, and especially if
during this interval the climate was mild, the oxidation and
weathering of the older drift surface would be markedly different
in degree from that of the newer. If, under these circumstances,
the surface of the older sheet were found to be weathered and
oxidized and reddened up to the border of the newer drift sheet,
and if here there were found to be a sudden change in the character
of the surface of the drift so far as depth and degree of
oxidization and weathering is concerned, we should have strong
evidence that the one sheet of drift was much older than the
other. The statement sometimes urged that the drift which was
deposited near the edge of the greatest ice advance would be
largely made up of the residual materials which occupied the
surface invaded by the ice, would not meet the case. For if it be
granted that this statement is qualitatively good, we should find
the greatest degree of weathering and oxidation at the extreme
margin of the drift, and it should be found to be less and less on
receding from this margin. There would in this case be no
sudden transition from a deeply weathered and oxidized surface,
to one which is fresh and unoxidized, along a definite line. We
maintain that if the whole of the drift deposits are referable to
one epoch, there should be no sudden transition in the surface
of the drift from that which is deeply weathered to that which
is not, the one surface being separated from the other by a definite
and readily traceable line.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">« 74 »</a></span></p>

<p>It has been urged against the criterion of differential weathering
that superglacial material is or may be thoroughly oxidized
before its deposition, and that a layer of oxidized drift between
layers of till may be no more than superglacial debris deposited
during a minor recession of the ice.<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> We believe that this
attempt to eliminate the value of this criterion rests partly on an
exaggerated idea concerning the amount of superglacial material,
but more especially on a failure to apprehend the real meaning
of the argument for the validity of the criterion, and upon a
failure to note the limitations imposed upon it by its advocates.
It is not affirmed that a layer of oxidized drift between beds of
unoxidized drift is <i>per se</i> proof of two glacial epochs; but it is
affirmed that if such layer of weathered drift can be shown to
extend far below any possible superglacial till, into the subglacial
till below, in such wise as to indicate that it is the result
of subaërial exposure in a warm climate subsequent to its
deposition and prior to the deposition of the overlying till, it
constitutes the best possible evidence of an interglacial epoch,
especially when accompanied by the corroborative testimony of
other criteria. It is further affirmed that if the second sheet of
drift failed to reach the limit of the first, and if the drift which
was deposited by the first and never covered by the second ice-sheet,
is more thoroughly and more deeply weathered than that
deposited by the second, and especially if the two types of drift
surface meet along a definite and readily traceable line, the argument
becomes, in our judgment, irrefragable. In its application,
this criterion would be infallible only in the hands of one who
could distinguish between superglacial and superglacially oxidized
material on the one hand, and material subaërially weathered
after its deposition, on the other.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_16" id="Footnote_16"></a><a href="#FNanchor_16"><span class="label">[16]</span></a> This point was urged at the reading of the paper at Ottawa, by Prof. C. H.
Hitchcock, Mr. Upham, and others.</p></div>

<p>In circumstances and relations where the weathering of the
drift is not in itself conclusive, it might still have corroborative
value in association with other lines of evidence.</p>

<p>The absence of an oxidized and disintegrated zone of drift
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">« 75 »</a></span>
below a superficial layer which is not oxidized, would be no
proof that there were not distinct ice epochs, since the ice of any
later epoch, if such there were, might have planed off the surface
of the drift left by its predecessor to the depth of the
weathering. The preservation of such surfaces after a second
ice invasion must be regarded as the exception rather than as the
rule. There is always the possibility, too, that an oxidized and
weathered zone marking the surface of an older drift sheet
exists, where excavations have not opened full sections of drift
to view. The absence of weathered zones of drift beneath the
surface, or the absence of knowledge of their existence, is
therefore at best no more than negative evidence. The absence
of greater weathering of the drift outside the limit of the drift
supposed to belong to a later epoch, would be positive evidence
against the reference of the two sheets of drift concerned to
different epochs.</p>

<p>A specific part of the above line of evidence may be separately
mentioned. One phase of weathering is the disintegration
of boulders, and this is a point which can be readily applied
even by those who are not geologists. If the boulders of one
region are much more commonly disintegrated than those of
another, and if the two regions are separated from each other
by a well-marked boundary line, the inference lies close at hand
that the boulders in the one case have been much longer exposed
to disintegrating agencies than in the other. It is no answer to
this argument to say that the materials lying at the very front
of the drift deposits contain boulders which were derived from
the disintegrated rock over which the ice has passed, and that
they were therefore in a less firm state at the outset. In many
cases these boulders have come from great distances, and coming
from great distances they must have come in a firm and
solid state, else they could not have suffered such extensive
transportation, except indeed their position was superglacial
throughout their whole journey. This argument has equal force
when applied to the area covered by the two sheets of drift
where two exist. If within the region of drift under investigation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">« 76 »</a></span>
we find a surface layer of greater or less depth, the boulders
of which are hard and fresh, and if beneath this we find another
layer of drift, the stony material of which is largely disintegrated,
at least in its upper parts, we have good evidence that the
surface bearing the disintegrated boulders was exposed for a
considerable length of time before the deposition of the overlying
drift, which carries fresh boulders. Since the disintegration
of boulders is only one phase of weathering, the limitations
of this argument are identical with those already noted in
connection with the general argument from differential
weathering.</p>

<p>(7) <i>Differential Subaërial Erosion.</i> If the drift deposited by
one ice-sheet were to be exposed for a considerable interval of
time, and if the ice in its subsequent advance failed to reach the
limit of its first invasion, the two areas should show different
amounts of subaërial erosion, since the one has been exposed to
the action of air and water much longer than the other. The
line which marks the limit of the later ice invasion should be the
line of more or less sudden transition from an area without,
where stream erosion has been greater, to an area within, where
stream erosion has been less.</p>

<p>The point here made can not be met by the suggestion that
the greater erosion of the outer area was effected by the water
issuing from the ice which had retreated to the position now
marked by the border of the area of the lesser erosion. So far
as we know, such waters would be depositing, not eroding.
Furthermore, much of the erosion of the outer area would have
such relation to drainage lines that waters issuing from the ice
could never have reached the localities where it is shown.</p>

<p>If the outer and older drift be found to have suffered ten
times as much stream erosion as the inner and newer, it is fair to
assume that it has been exposed something like ten times as
long, if the conditions for erosion are equally favorable in the
two regions. The argument has especial weight if it can be
found that beneath the newer drift the surface of the older is
such as to indicate that it was deeply eroded before the newer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">« 77 »</a></span>
was placed upon it. The argument is stronger the farther from
the margin of the newer drift such erosion on the surface of the
underlying older drift can be proved to have taken place. In
other words, if, in addition to the greater surface erosion of the
older drift sheet as now exposed outside the limit of the newer
drift, we find a notable unconformity between the newer and the
older drift, and especially if this unconformity lie far enough
north of the margin of the newer drift, the argument becomes
conclusive.</p>

<p>When differential erosion and drift unconformities are not in
themselves conclusive, they may have great corroborative value
in conjunction with differential weathering, forest beds, or other
indications of separate ice epochs.</p>

<p>The absence of observable unconformity between sheets of
drift would be no proof that there were not distinct and widely
separated ice epochs, since the later ice invasion might have so
far modified the surface which it transgressed, as to destroy all
patent evidences of unconformity. It would have been anticipated
that distinct unconformities in the drift would be rare,
even if there were distinct ice epochs, for the same reason that
weathered zones and forest beds would be rare. But if the drift
which lies outside a line supposed to mark the limit of a sheet of
drift belonging to a later ice epoch, be not more eroded than
that which lies within such line, the absence of greater erosion in
the outer drift is positive evidence against the reference of the
drift of the two areas to distinct ice epochs, if conditions for
erosion in the two areas are equally favorable.</p>

<p>(8) <i>Valleys Excavated Between Successive Depositions of Drift.</i>
A closely related, but not identical, point may be found in the
extent of the valley excavations which can be proved to have
taken place between the deposition of the earlier and later drift.
We do not refer to valleys excavated in the drift especially, but
to those excavated in other formations as well. If it can be
shown, for example, that after the deposition of an earlier drift
sheet, and before the deposition of a later, valleys were excavated
which extended not merely into the drift itself, but far
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">« 78 »</a></span>
beneath the drift into the underlying rock, these valleys would be
conclusive evidence of a long interval between the deposition of
the two bodies of drift. The argument is of especial force when
such excavations in the rock beneath the drift can be shown to
have taken place at great distances within the margin of the
newer drift. For valleys in such situations imply that the ice
had receded at least as far to the north as they lie, during the
interval between the two drift depositions, and may be so situated
as to show that the ice had wholly left the drainage basin
where they occur.</p>

<p>The absence of evidences of deep valley excavations in any
given region during a supposed interglacial epoch, is no proof
that such interval did not exist. The conditions may not have
been everywhere favorable for erosion within the limits of any
narrowly circumscribed area, and the absence of interglacial
valleys would be only negative evidence against an interglacial
epoch. The absence of such evidence everywhere would bear
against the existence of an interglacial epoch of much duration
in such wise as to be more than negative evidence.</p>

<p>(9) <i>Different Directions of Movement.</i> If, after its maximum
advance, the ice suffered merely a minor recession and then
remained stationary, or nearly so, for a time, the general direction
of its movement in a subsequent advance would probably
be essentially the same as in the earlier. But if, after its maximum
advance, the ice receded to a great distance, and especially
if it entirely disappeared, a subsequent ice-sheet might have a
very different direction of movement, since its center of accumulation
and dispersion might be very different. It is conceivable
that this center might shift during the history of a
single ice-sheet. In this case there should be a gradual change
in the direction of ice movement, not an abrupt one. If, therefore,
there be found one sheet of drift made by an ice movement
in one direction, overlaid by another sheet of drift deposited
by ice moving in a very different direction, with an abrupt
transition between them, such drift sheets would be presumptive
evidence of distinct ice epochs. An exception would need to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">« 79 »</a></span>
be made in the case of drift sheets along the margins of confluent
or proximate ice lobes. In such cases, if the one lobe
temporarily secured the advantage of the other, drift beds
formed by movements from opposite directions might be found
in vertical succession, without being evidence of separate ice
epochs.</p>

<p>It is no part of the purpose of this essay to point out the
difficulties which might arise in the application of this criterion
of diverse directions of ice movements. It is possible that
gradual changes in the direction of movement might leave records
which would seem to indicate abrupt changes instead. This possibility
makes care necessary in the application of the criterion,
but does not destroy its value. When not itself conclusive, this
criterion may be so associated with differential weathering, differential
erosion, forest beds, etc., that their combined testimony
makes but one conclusion possible.</p>

<p>The absence of evidence of radically diverse directions of
movement during the time of deposition of the various sheets of
drift, would be no proof that there were not distinct epochs. In
the first place, the movements of different epochs might be harmonious&mdash;a
condition of things more probable than any other if
the more common views of the causes of glaciation be correct.
In the second place, if the movements were diverse, the deposits
might still be so similar that their differentiation, when the one
is buried, might not be easily made. In the third place, the
later ice might have so far incorporated the older drift material
with that which belonged more properly to it, as to have
destroyed all definition between them.</p>

<p>(10) <i>The Superposition of Beds of Till of Different Physical
Constitution.</i> After the retreat of an ice-sheet, the surface of the
country thus discovered would be largely mantled with drift.
This drift would serve to protect the underlying rock from disintegration.
But where there was little or no drift, the rock surface
would be subject to all the disrupting agencies which affect
surface rocks. The same would be true of all rock surfaces
bared by subaërial erosion after the disappearance of the ice.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">« 80 »</a></span>
Under these conditions, if a second sheet of ice invaded the
region in question after it had been long exposed, it would find
a surface prepared to yield large bowlders. The result would
be the deposition of a new sheet of drift containing bowlders
much larger than those which would have been proper to an ice-sheet
overspreading a surface but recently abandoned. If, therefore,
in the upper of two layers of subglacial till, bowlders of
great size predominate, as compared with those of a lower homologous
layer, they may be indicative of a great interval of time
between the deposition of the upper and lower beds of drift. If
the home of these bowlders be far north of the limit of the lesser
sheet of drift, the distance, as well as the duration, of the ice
retreat must have been great, and the reference of the two beds
of till to distinct ice epochs would be favored. The case might
be so strong as to make no other interpretation possible. Where
in itself inconclusive, this criterion would have corroborative
significance. In its application, the discrimination of subglacial
and superglacial till would be imperative.</p>

<p>The absence of physical dissimilarity between superposed
layers of subglacial till would not be proof of the absence of
separate glacial epochs. The phenomena constituting the criterion
could hardly be expected to be of common occurrence.
They would never be obtrusive, and may easily have escaped
attention where they exist.<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_17" id="Footnote_17"></a><a href="#FNanchor_17"><span class="label">[17]</span></a> The 10th criterion, in the order here named, was suggested by Mr. McGee in
the discussion which followed the reading of the paper at Ottawa.</p></div>

<p>(11) <i>Varying Altitudes and Attitudes of the Land.</i> Another
line of argument has to do with the altitude and attitude of the
land during the deposition of various members of the drift complex.
If during the deposition of one part of the drift that part
of the continent covered by the outer part of the ice was low,
the drainage from it would be sluggish. If the deposits of
this drainage persist to the present time, we may find in their
character evidence of the nature of the drainage, and therefore
of the attitude of the land. If at a later time of drift deposition
the glacial drainage in the same region was more vigorous,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">« 81 »</a></span>
the deposits made by the glacial streams would be correspondingly
coarser. In these deposits, if they persist to the present
day, we should find conclusive evidence of the swiftness of the
streams. If it can be shown that during the deposition of one
sheet of drift drainage was sluggish, and that during the deposition
of a later body of drift the drainage was vigorous, these
facts are evidence of an interval between the two times of drift
deposition, sufficiently long to accomplish the corresponding
changes in elevation or attitude. Since such changes of altitude
and attitude are generally believed to have been accomplished
slowly, the interval must be believed to have been of considerable
duration.</p>

<p>It is true that continental altitudes and attitudes might
change during a single epoch of glaciation. If the change thus
brought about resulted in increased slope, the more sluggish
drainage of the earlier part of the epoch would be gradually
transformed into the more vigorous drainage of the later part.
In this case, if the evidence of both the earlier sluggish drainage
and of the later vigorous drainage remain, there should also
remain the evidence of the intermediate stages. If the deposits
representing the intermediate condition of drainage do not exist,
while those representing both extremes do, there would be the
best of reason for believing that the intermediate phases of drainage
did not exist during a glacial epoch, but during an interglacial
epoch, when streams were not handling glacial debris, and when
they were eroding rather than depositing. The deposits of the
slow and of the swift drainage might occur in such relations as
to prove, beyond peradventure, that intermediate stages of <i>glacial</i>
drainage never existed.</p>

<p>If the sluggish drainage accompanied the maximum ice invasion,
while the vigorous accompanied a lesser, the evidence of
the swift streams might be found far north of the southern limit
of the earlier drift. The farther north of the outer border of
the older drift the gravel representing the vigorous drainage of
the later and minor ice-sheet occurs, the further the ice must
have retreated before the change from the one type of drainage
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">« 82 »</a></span>
to the other was effected. On the other hand, the farther north
of the limit of the later ice advance the sluggish drainage accompanying
the earlier ice-sheet may be traced, the farther must
the ice have receded before the changes resulting in vigorous
drainage occurred. Under certain relations, the retreat of the
ice might be shown to have been great enough, before the
orographic movements which altered the nature of the drainage,
to constitute in our judgment, a re-advance a distinct ice epoch.
If for example throughout the course of a long river whose basin
was largely covered with ice, there be evidence that sluggish
drainage obtained during the maximum ice advance, and during
all stages of the ice retreat until the basin was free from ice, and
if there be evidence of a vigorous glacial drainage in the same
valley at a later time, with no gradations between the two types,
we have proof positive of at least a great recession, and of a
considerable elevation of the land after the ice had receded
beyond the limits of the drainage basin and before it again
reached it in its re-advance. We hold that these phases of
glacial drainage deposits may be so related to each other, to the
valleys in which they occur, and to more or less distinct bodies
of glacier drift, as to prove so great a recession of ice between
the diverse phases of drainage deposition, as to constitute the
second advance a distinct ice epoch.</p>

<p>The absence of evidence that the land stood at different
elevations during different parts of the period of drift deposition,
does not in any way militate against the theory of recurrent
and distinct ice epochs. A constant attitude of the land is
the thing to be assumed, until positive evidence to the contrary
is adduced.</p>

<p>(12) <i>Vigor and Sluggishness of Ice Action.</i> If it can be shown
that during one epoch of glaciation, we will say the epoch of maximum
ice extension, the ice action was relatively sluggish, while
during a later and minor advance its action was vigorous, the
difference of action might be regarded as presumptive evidence
of distinct ice epochs. Evidence of the two phases of ice action
here referred to are difficult of definition, but they have been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">« 83 »</a></span>
independently noted by more than one glacialist. It is true that
a forward oscillation of the ice edge might be more forceful than
an earlier forward movement which might have reached a greater
extension. In itself, therefore, this line of evidence can not be
regarded as possessing great value.</p>

<p>It has been indicated that under certain circumstances, and
in certain relations, some of the foregoing criteria, taken singly,
may be conclusive of glaciations so distinct from each other, as
to make their reference to separate epochs proper. But where
the facts and relations which constitute one of the criteria are
found, the facts and relations constituting one or more of the
others are likely to be found as well. Where two of the foregoing
criteria are found to be coexistent, their joint force is
greater than that of either one. If neither one be absolutely
conclusive, the two may still be, since the one may exactly meet
the deficiency of the other. If three or more concurrent lines
of evidence exist in any locality, the case is still further strengthened.
We maintain that several of the foregoing criteria may
be so related to each other and to the formations concerned, as
not only to make the recognition of separate ice epochs proper,
but to make the failure of such recognition altogether unscientific.
Even when a single line of evidence, or when double, or
triple, or quadruple lines of evidence are not absolutely conclusive
in ruling out every conceivable technical escape from the
conclusion that there were separate ice epochs, their cumulative
and corroborative force may still be such as to carry conviction
scarcely less positive than that which mathematical demonstration
would afford. In the nature of the case not all of these
various lines of evidence could be expected to be found in
any one locality, or perhaps in any one limited geographic area,
but where one occurs, some or all of the others are liable to
be found under favoring circumstance. The number of criteria,
and the great extent of area where they may hope for application,
afford great possibilities.</p>

<p>From the foregoing discussion, it will be readily seen that the
nature of the criteria and the limitations imposed upon their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">« 84 »</a></span>
application by the difficulty of proving stratigraphic continuity
in such a formation as the drift, necessitate the greatest care in
their use, and reduce the value of hasty and inexpert conclusions
to a minimum.</p>


<h3>IV. <span class="smcap">Areas Where the Criteria find Readiest Application.</span></h3>

<p>The foregoing criteria find their readiest application in
regions where a later sheet of drift, suspected of belonging to a
later ice epoch, failed to reach the border of an earlier sheet of
drift, suspected of belonging to an earlier ice epoch. The 1st,
2d, 3d, 4th, 5th and 10th as enumerated above, find their application
wholly within the area affected by the drift of the separate
epochs, if such there were. While within this general area
they may be looked for at any point, they are likely to be of
rare occurrence, except along a somewhat narrow belt, say 50
to 100 miles, adjacent to the border of the lesser ice advance.
The conditions for their occurrence and detection are greatly
favored if the lesser drift sheet be the later. The 6th, 7th, 9th
and 12th criteria might hope for application within the same
belt, but especially along a narrow zone on either side of the
margin of the later drift sheet. It is along this zone that the
types of surface are thrown into sharpest contrast, both as to
material and topography. The 8th and 11th criteria have still
wider limits of application, both within and without the border
of the lesser ice advance.</p>

<p>It is the chief function of the national, state and provincial
geological surveys to bring forth the great concrete facts relative
to the structure and resources of their several fields. Within
their special domains they also do an important work in the correlation
of structures and formations, in the systematic aggregation
of the facts, in the organizing of results, and in the
development of the fundamental principles of geological science.
To some extent they are permitted to do this beyond their own
fields, but in the main the boundaries of these fields are the
limits of their coördinations. They therefore leave a great
function to be performed by some other agency in the coördination
of interstate, international, and intercontinental factors.
They are also restrained by their relationships to a somewhat
too narrowly utilitarian public from devoting much direct attention
to the solution of the deeper and broader problems that
constitute the soul of science, though their contributions bear
upon these in the most radical and important way. In the
primary work of systematic observation, and the development
of the immediate conclusions that spring therefrom, these surveys
surpass all other agencies in the value of their contributions
to the growth of the science, but in the secondary and ulterior
work of correlation, in the synthetic aggregation and organization
of results, and in the analytical and philosophical treatment of the
whole, they need to be supplemented by agencies whose facilities
and limitations lie in other lines, agencies whose relations and
dependencies are complementary in nature. This secondary
and ulterior work, in some degree, has been done by individual
master students of systematic and philosophical geology, but to a
very great extent it has not been done at all. It is a function which
properly falls to universities, if the universities can only rise to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">« 86 »</a></span>
meet it; for it is the function of universities, in the larger modern
view, not only to rehearse science, nor merely even to educate
young geologists, important as that is, but to develop science for
science's own sake, and for its own inherent and permanent
utilities as distinguished from its immediate applicabilities. To
fulfill this function they must not only realize and appreciate it,
but they must be equipped for field and experimental work, as
well as library and laboratory study. Ideal correlations and
academic systematizing are as apt to be hindrances as helps to
the progress of science. While a few of the great universities
of this country and Europe have made notable advances in these
directions, the universities are, on the whole, far behind the
great surveys in the performance of the work which properly
falls to them. This is due not so much to a lack of appreciation
of the function as to the lack of facilities.</p>

<p>With the development of this higher function of the universities
there goes a coördinate function for a university journal
of geology, a journal whose special efforts shall be devoted to
promoting the growth of systematic, philosophical, and fundamental
geology, and to the education of professional geologists.
No part of the wide domain can wisely be neglected by any
journal, but there seems to be an open field for a periodical
which specially invites the discussion of systematic and fundamental
themes, and of international and intercontinental relations,
and which in particular seeks to promote the study of
geographic and continental evolution, orographic movements,
volcanic coördinations and consanguinities, biological developments
and migrations, climatic changes, and similar questions of
wide and fundamental interest. This field is not likely to be
successfully cultivated except by a systematic endeavor, pursued
through a period of years, to bring together the latest and best
summations of the results attained in the several national fields
in a common medium, where they can be compared and discussed,
and where tentative correlations will suggest themselves,
out of which, in turn, working hypotheses will naturally spring,
leading on to such direct investigations as the nature of each
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">« 87 »</a></span>
question invites. It would be presumptuous to assume that the
<span class="smcap">Journal of Geology</span> can cultivate with more than very partial
success this field, but it especially invites contributions of this
class.</p>

<p>Another phase of geology which is thought to stand in much
need of active cultivation is found in the clear and sharp analysis
of its processes, the exhaustive classification of its phenomena,
especially on genetic bases, the development of criteria of discrimination,
the more complete evolution and formulation of its
principles and the development of its working methods. The
recent opening of new fields of research and the rapid progress
of several new and important departments of the science give
peculiar emphasis to this need. The rising generation of geologists,
the hope of the science, should be schooled in these
latest and most critical aspects of the science. A department of
the <span class="smcap">Journal</span>, entitled "Studies for Students," has been opened
for the special cultivation of this field and for its adaptation to
advanced students and progressive teachers of geology. Mere
elementary presentations of processes and principles are not
desired, but searching and critical expositions are solicited
suited to the needs of young geologists who seek the highest
professional equipment, and to progressive teachers who desire
the fullest practicable command of the newest developments of
the subject. These contributions may not be without their value
to those who have already borne a considerable part of the heat
and burden of life's professional day.</p>

<p>It is our desire to open the pages of the <span class="smcap">Journal</span> as broadly
as a due regard for merit will permit, and to free it as much as
possible from local and institutional aspects. It will have the
very important advantage of being published under the auspices
and guarantee of the University of Chicago, and will be free
from the usual financial embarrassments attending the publication
of a scientific magazine. This necessarily imposes upon
the local editors the immediate responsibility for its editorship.
Beyond this, it is hoped that its institutional relationship will
disappear entirely in an earnest effort to promote the widest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">« 88 »</a></span>
interests of the science. As an earnest of this wider effort
several eminent geologists, representing some of the leading
universities of this country, and some of the great geological
organizations of Europe, have kindly consented to act as associate
editors.</p>

<p>Upon invitation of the World's Congress Auxiliary of the
World's Columbian Exposition committees were appointed by
the several sections of the American Association for the Advancement
of Science at its Rochester meeting to coöperate with
it in completing the organization of scientific congresses to be
held at Chicago in connection with the forthcoming World's
Fair. The committee appointed by the geological and geographical
section consisted of Thomas C. Chamberlin, John C.
Branner, Grove K. Gilbert, W. J. McGee, Rollin D. Salisbury,
Eugene A. Smith, Charles D. Walcott, J. F. Whiteaves, Geo. H.
Williams, H. S. Williams and N. H. Winchell.</p>

<p>It has been arranged that this committee should undertake
the work of preparing the scientific program for the Geological
Congress. The committee have prepared a provisional schedule
of topics, which they have submitted to the Advisory Council
for revision. It has seemed to the committee that all contributions
should be such as to have an international interest.
Preferably, they should be subjects that can only be treated most
advantageously in such a congress, especially those that involve
the bringing together of data from different lands for comparison.
The committee suggest the organization of the subjects under
the following general classes:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">First.</span> Such as shall show the present state of geological
progress. It is believed that this can best be done by an exhibition
of geological maps which shall show the latest and best
results of official and other surveys. As such maps will be prepared,
it is hoped, for the World's Fair, duplicates can be made
at a slight expense for the use of the Congress. It is hoped
that each country that has made any notable progress in mapping
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">« 89 »</a></span>
its geological formations will furnish for the Congress at least
a general geological map, if not also special or analytical maps.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Second.</span> Such subjects as bear upon continental growth and
intercontinental relations. It is proposed to make this a leading
line of discussion during the Congress, in the belief that there is
no subject more appropriate, and that there is none which better
represents the present efforts of geologists or commands a more
general interest. It is hoped that analytical maps will be prepared
by the geologists of the several countries representing the
stages of growth of these regions in each of the great eras from
the Archean to the Pleistocene, and that such analytical maps
may constitute a leading feature of the several presentations.
Among the subjects upon which contributions are specially invited
are the following: The correlation of continental and
intercontinental orographic movements and geographic accretions
by sedimentation; The coördination of periods of vulcanism
in the different countries; The coördination of climatic
states and changes; The correlation of faunal and floral variations
and migrations. It is hoped that one session may be
devoted to such coördination papers bearing upon each of the
great subdivisions: viz., Archean, Paleozoic, Mesozoic, Cenozoic,
and Pleistocene.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Third.</span> Papers on Paleontological and Archeological Geology
of international scope.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fourth.</span> Contributions to Physical, Structural and Petrological
Geology having international or general bearings.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fifth.</span> Contributions to Economic Geology having general
bearings.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sixth.</span> Miscellaneous papers of especial and general interest.</p>

<p>The foregoing groups are intended to embrace and coördinate
the list of special themes announced in the circular issued
by the local committee some months since, except such as may
be best suited to popular presentation, for which special provision
is to be made.</p>

<p>It will be determined later, when the number and nature of
the papers are ascertained, whether all will be arranged so as to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">« 90 »</a></span>
form a continuous program, or whether sub-sections will be
formed and two or more sessions held simultaneously.</p>

<p>It is the desire of the World's Congress Auxiliary that a few
addresses of a popular nature shall be given, with a view to
stimulating an interest in the development of the science on the
part of the public.</p>

<p><i>On the Glacial Succession in Europe.</i> By Prof. <span class="smcap">James Geikie</span>. Transactions
of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, Vol. XXXVII., Part
I. (No. 9), 1892, pp. 127-149 (with a map).</p></div>

<p>In this timely essay Prof. Geikie reaches the following conclusions:</p>

<p>1. The record of the first glacial epoch is found in the Weyborn
Crag of Britain, and the ground moraine beneath the "Lower Diluvium"
of the continent. During this epoch, the direction of the ice
movement in southern Sweden was from the south-east to the northwest.
This first glacial epoch of which direct evidence is adduced
was followed by an interglacial interval, during which the forest-bed
of Cromer, the breccia of Hötting, the lignites of Leffe and Pianico,
and certain beds in central France were deposited. During this interglacial
epoch, the climate is believed to have been very mild.</p>

<p>2. There followed a second epoch of glaciation, when the ice
sheet of Britain became confluent with that of the continent. This
was the epoch during which the ice sheet reached its southernmost
extension. Its depositions are found in the lower boulder clays of
Britain, the lower diluvium of Scandinavia and north Germany (in
part), the lower glacial deposits of south Germany and central Russia,
the ground moraines and high level gravel terraces of Alpine lands,
and the terminal moraines of the outer zone. During this second
glacial epoch, Alpine glaciers are believed to have attained their
greatest development. This epoch of extreme glaciation was followed
by an interglacial interval, during which Britain is believed to have
been joined to the continent. During this interval, the climate became
temperate. In Russia (near Moscow) there seems to be evidence that
it was milder and more humid than that of the same region at the
present day. Toward the close of the mild epoch, submergence seems
to have been accompanied by an increasing degree of cold, which
finally ended in another glacial epoch.</p>

<p>3. The subsidence which marked the close of the second interglacial
interval, marked likewise the inauguration of the third glacial
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">« 92 »</a></span>
epoch. Its work is represented in Britain by the upper boulder clay,
in Scandinavia and Germany by the lower diluvium (in part), in central
Russia by the upper glacial series, in Alpine lands by ground moraines
and gravel terraces. The ice sheets of Scandinavia and Britain were
again confluent, but did not extend quite so far south as during the
second glacial epoch. This third glacial epoch is believed to have
been followed by another interglacial interval, during which fresh water
alluvia, lignite and peat accumulations were made. These are represented
by the interglacial beds of north Germany, and by some of
the so-called post-glacial alluvia of Britain. There were also marine
deposits on the coasts of Britain and on the borders of the Baltic.
During this interglacial interval, Britain is believed to have been continental.
The climate was temperate, but in the course of time became
more severe. This increasing severity seems to have been accompanied
by submergence, which amounted to something like 100 ft. below
the present sea-level on the coasts of Scotland. The Baltic provinces
of Germany were also invaded by the waters of the North Sea.</p>

<p>4. There followed a fourth period of glaciation, during which
the major part of the Scottish Highland was covered by an ice sheet.
Local ice sheets existed in the southern uplands of Scotland and in
mountain districts in other parts of Britain, and the great valley
glaciers sometimes coalesced on the low lands. Icebergs floated out
at the mouths of some of the highland sea-lochs. In some places,
terminal moraines were deposited upon marine beds which were then
in process of formation. These beds are now 100 ft. above the sea
level. At this time Scandinavia was covered by a great ice sheet,
which yielded icebergs to the sea along the whole west coast of Norway.
The ground moraines and terminal moraines of the mountain
regions of Britain represent the deposits of this ice epoch. The
upper diluvium of Scandinavia, Finland, and north Germany represent
the work of the contemporaneous, but not confluent, ice sheet of
the continent. In the Alps, terminal moraines in the large longitudinal
valleys were made at the same time.</p>

<p>This fourth glacial epoch was followed by a fourth interglacial
interval, during which fresh water alluvial deposits were made, and
also the "lower buried forest and peat" of Britain and northwestern
Europe. At this time, Scotland seems to have stood 45 to
50 feet lower than now, and Carse clays and raised beaches represent
the work of the sea. During this interglacial interval, Britain is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">« 93 »</a></span>
believed to have become again continental, while the climate became
so far ameliorated as to allow the growth of great forests. Subsequently
the insulation of Britain was effected, and this was followed
by a climate which was probably colder than the present.</p>

<p>5. The severity of the climate which marked the close of the
fourth interglacial interval was such as to bring about local glaciation
in some of the mountain valleys of Britain. Here and there the
glaciers projected their moraines so far down the mountains that they
rest on what is now the 45 to 50 feet beach. In the Alps, this fifth
epoch of glaciation is represented by the so-called post-glacial moraines
in the upper valleys. This is believed to have been the last appearance
of glaciers in Britain. The dissolution of these glaciers was again
followed by an emergence of the island, and by more genial climatic
conditions.</p>

<p>In support of his conclusions, Prof. Geikie cites some striking
facts which are not so widely known as they should be. For example,
Swedish geologists have found evidences that there was an ice sheet
antedating that which deposited the "lower diluvium," and that during
this earlier glaciation the direction of ice movement in southern
Sweden was from the south-east to the north-west. The ground
moraine deposited by this ice sheet is overlain by the "lower diluvium"
which was produced by an ice movement from the north north-east to
the south south-west, or nearly at right angles to the first. Again, near
Moscow, there exist interglacial beds whose plant remains indicate a
climate milder and more humid than that of the present time. These
interglacial beds, it will be observed, occur in the region of the
"lower diluvium" quite beyond the margin of the ice which produced
the "upper diluvium" of Germany and Scandinavia. During this interglacial
interval, Prof. Geikie maintains that no part of Russia could
have been covered with ice. If, then, within the limits of the area
covered by the "lower diluvium," and not by the "upper," distinct
beds of glacial drift are separated by such beds as those cited, there
can be no question but that such separation marks two distinct glacial
epochs. If there was an earlier glaciation when the movement of the
ice in Sweden was at right angles to that during which the lower part
of the "lower diluvium" was produced, this also would seem to be good
evidence of three ice epochs prior to the "upper diluvium." The epoch
of the "upper diluvium" would then constitute the fourth glacial epoch,
and this is the interpretation of Prof. Geikie.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">« 94 »</a></span></p>

<p>Outside the area of the European continental ice sheet, facts are
adduced in striking confirmation of the multiple ice epoch theory.
These facts are found in Switzerland, where evidences of multiple
glaciation have been recognized, and in the Pyrenees where evidences
of three separate ice epochs have been found. In France, evidences
of an interglacial interval have been found in the region of the Puy
de Dôme of such duration as to allow the excavation of valleys to a
depth of 900 feet. The length of time which would be required for
such stupendous erosion must certainly be regarded as sufficient to
allow the preceding and succeeding glaciations to be considered as
belonging to two distinct epochs.</p>

<p>Another point of great significance and interest which Prof.
Geikie's essay brings out, is the correlation in Britain between epochs
of glaciation and epochs of subsidence on the one hand, and
between interglacial intervals and epochs of elevation on the other.
If Prof. Geikie's interpretation be well founded, and so far as we are
able to judge from the facts presented this is the case, his conclusions
would seem to be fatal to the hypothesis that glacial climate was produced
by northern elevation.</p>

<p>The map which Prof. Geikie gives, showing the limit of ice
advance during the fourth glacial epoch, seems to us open to criticism.
On the ground of personal observation, the writer believes that the ice
sheet of the glacial epoch here represented did not extend notably, if
at all, beyond the Baltic Ridge.<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_18" id="Footnote_18"></a><a href="#FNanchor_18"><span class="label">[18]</span></a> See <i>American Journal of Science</i>, May, 1887. In a recent letter, Prof. Geikie
indicates that he is convinced, from subsequent personal observation, that his map is
erroneous so far as the limit of the ice of this epoch is concerned. The mapping
given was based on the opinion of others.</p></div>

<p>Prof. Geikie is an advocate of Dr. Croll's astronomical theory of
glacial climate, and thinks that even five is not the full number of
glacial epochs belonging to the Pleistocene period. He believes there
may have been a series of glacial epochs increasing in severity to a maximum
represented by what is now designated as the second glacial epoch.
This maximum was followed by a series of epochs of diminishing severity,
represented by what he designates the third, fourth and fifth epochs. The
essay is a timely contribution to glacial geology.</p>

eskers and sand plateaus (plains) were formed. The Auburndale district,
ten miles east of Boston, presents three classes of modified drift deposits;&mdash;sand
plateaus, eskers, and kames. These deposits are well exposed.</p>

<p>The sand plateaus have the characteristics of delta deposits of glacial
streams,&mdash;even surfaces, well-bedded sands and gravels, the beds sloping outward
from the "head" at an angle of 12° to 20°, and in close agreement
with the slope of the plateau front, a lobate margin, deposits distinctly coarser
at the head than near the front, and a series of nearly horizontal roughly
cross-bedded gravels overlying the sloping beds.</p>

<p>The eskers are essentially of the same material as that of the plateau,
often so poorly stratified as to render differentiation of the beds difficult. The
interstices between the pebbles are often unfilled, although there is abundance
of fine material in adjoining layers. This "open work" is taken to
indicate rapid deposition, and seems to preclude the supposition that the
gravels have settled down from a superglacial position, or been traversed by
currents of any volume. In several instances the eskers can be followed to
direct union with sand plateaus. Towards its lower end the esker frequently
"gives out branches" and "the adjacent lowland surface becomes more or
less encumbered with sand mounds or kames," indicating a decayed margin
of the ice.</p>

<p>Prof. Davis' conclusions are:</p>

<p>"1. The eskers and sand plateaus of Auburndale and Newtonville were
formed by running water just inside and outside of the ice margin in the
closing stage of the last glacial epoch.</p>

<p>"2. The ice-sheet was a stagnant, decaying mass at the time of their
formation, as is shown by the ragged outline of its margin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">« 96 »</a></span></p>

<p>"3. Eskers and sand plateaus are genetically connected; the term, feeding-esker,
is fully warranted by the relation of the two in position, structure,
and composition.</p>

<p>"4. The sand plateaus were made rapidly; this is proved by the absence
of disordered beds at their heads, where space would have been opened by the
backward melting of the ice had the forward growth of the plateau been slow.
The eskers were also made rapidly, as is shown by their 'open-work gravels.'</p>

<p>"5. The diversion of the feeding streams to other outlets left the plateaus and
the eskers without further energetic action as the ice melted away from them.</p>

<p>"6. The present form and structure of the eskers are more accordant
with the supposition of a subglacial origin than of a superglacial origin; but
it is not intended to imply that other eskers of more irregular form and different
structure could not have been deposited in superglacial channels."</p>

<p><i>Studies in Structural Geology.</i> By <span class="smcap">Bailey Willis</span>, U. S. Geol. Surv.
(Transactions of the American Institute of Mining Engineers,
June, 1892).</p></div>

<p>The paper aims "to present some of the results of observation of the
geologists of the Appalachian division during the past three years on the
subject of structural geology in the Appalachian province." The structural
features are all of one type but of different phases, comprised in four great
districts. 1) the district of close folding, 2) a district whose chief structural
characteristic is cleavage, 3) a district of open folding, 4) a district of faulting
and folding. The answer to the questions, Why did the strata bend in
the district of open folding, and why did they break in the district of faulting,
is that the thrust affected them according to their rigidity under their
respective conditions of superincumbent load. "We know that load up to
a certain point restrains fracture in material under thrust." In the district
of open folding the Devonian limestone is the most rigid of the strata and
"the one which would most effectively transmit the compressing thrust and
would control the resulting structure." In the district of open folding this
limestone was prevented from breaking and faulting by a load of superincumbent
strata exerting a pressure of 10,000 to 23,000 pounds per square
inch, while in the faulted district a load of 5,000 to 10,000 pounds per square
inch permitted the strata to break and fault.</p>

<p>The answer to the question, Why did the compression affect this zone, is
given. "It becomes apparent on study of sections that where compression
raised a great arch there previously existed a bend from a nearly horizontal
to a descending position in the principal stratum transmitting the thrust.
Greater anticlines and synclines originated in upward and downward convexity
of initial dips, due to unequal deposits of sediments which depress
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">« 97 »</a></span>
underlying strata in proportion to their weight. Such folds may be called
original." The Pottsville, Mahanoy, Shamokin and Wyoming coal basins of
Pennsylvania belong to this class.</p>

<p>Experiments have recently been carried on in the office of the United
States Geological Survey reproducing the different forms of folding. The
experiments differed from other experiments in that 1) the materials used to
simulate the stratified rocks varied in consistency from brittle to plastic,
according to the depth at which deformation is supposed to take place; 2)
the compression was exerted under a movable load representing the weight
of superincumbent strata; 3) the strata rested on a yielding base to simulate
the condition of support of any arc of the earth's crust. The following are
the conclusions from the experiments:</p>

<p>1. "When a thrust tangentially affects a stratified mass, it is transmitted
in the direction of the strata, and by each stratum according to its inflexibility.
At any bend the force is resolved into components, one radial, the
other tangential to the dip beyond the bend; the radial component, if
directed downward, tends to depress the stratum and displace its support.</p>

<p>2. "A thrust so resolved can only raise an anticline or arch which is
strong enough to sustain the load lifted by its development; such an arch
may be called competent; and since strength is a function of the proportions
of a structure, it follows that, for a given stratum, the size of a competent
anticline will vary inversely as the load; or for a given load the size will
vary as the thickness of the effective stratum.</p>

<p>3. "The superincumbent load borne by a competent anticline is transferred
to the supports of the arch at the points of inflection of the limbs.</p>

<p>4. "When a competent arch is raised by thrust from one side, the load
transferred may so depress the resulting syncline further from the force that
an initial dip will be produced in otherwise undisturbed strata; this dip will
rise to a bend from which a new anticline may be developed. This anticline
is a result of the first, and may be called 'subsequent' in distinction to original
folds. Since subsequent folds are simply competent structures, their
size will be determined by conditions of thickness and load, and for like conditions
they should be equal; and they must, in consequence of conditions of
development, be parallel to the original fold and to each other. An example
of an original fold with its subsequent anticlines is the Nittany arch and the
group of parallel anticlines which lie southeast of it, extending northeast
from the Broad Top basin."</p>

<p><i>The Catskill Delta in the Post-Glacial Hudson Estuary.</i> By <span class="smcap">William
Morris Davis</span>. (From the Proceedings of the Boston Society of
Natural History, Vol. XXV., 1891).</p></div>

<p>The post-Tertiary trenches of the Hudson and its tributaries are in the
main filled with clay beds, which, covered by a thin deposit of sand, rise in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">« 98 »</a></span>
terraces 130, 150, or even 180 feet above tide-water. These clays are the
result of a late glacial or post-glacial submergence of the valley, but their
upper surface does not indicate the amount of their submergence, as they
are bottom deposits. Delta deposits made by the tributary streams, where
they entered the Hudson estuary, would indicate the amount of submergence.</p>

<p>Such deposits are found on the Catskill a mile north of Cairo, and eroded
remnants are traceable for three or four miles down stream. The surface is
characterized by great numbers of water-worn stones up to fifteen or eighteen
inches in diameter. The lobate margin, where present, is poorly
defined. These deposits range from 290 feet (aneroid) above tide, up
river, to 270 feet further down. One-tenth of a cubic mile of material seems
to have been washed into the Catskill trench at the point of this delta between
the time of the ice departure and the elevation of the land. Subsequent terracing
has removed half that amount.</p>

<p>The course of the Catskill at Leeds, where it crosses a ledge of hard
Corniferous limestone is probably of post-glacial superimposed origin, but
the preglacial valley cannot be definitely fixed.</p>

<p><i>Geological Survey of Alabama.&mdash;Bulletin 4.</i> By <span class="smcap">C. Willard Hayes</span>.
(Report of the Geology of Northeastern Alabama and Adjacent
Portions of Georgia and Tennessee).</p></div>

<p>This report covers an area of 5950 miles, two-thirds in Alabama. Topographically
it falls into three divisions: 1) the Cumberland and other
plateaus of the northwest; 2) in the center, anticlinal valleys&mdash;Browns and
Wills, with the synclinal mountains&mdash;Sand and Lookout; 3) the monoclinal
mountains, the "flatwoods" (Coosa shales) and the chert hills (Knox limestone)
of the southeast. The drainage of the first is radial from the center
of the plateau to the Tennessee; that of the second, once consequent upon
the folded structure, is now adjusted to the strike of the soft beds.</p>

<p>The formations are Cambrian, Silurian, Devonian and Carboniferous.
Total thickness is from 13,000 to 18,000 feet in the east, but decreases westward.
Hard sandstones of the Carboniferous form the cappings of the
plateaus and synclinal mountains. In the anticlinal and monoclinal valleys
the Silurian and Cambrian appear. The rocks pass from the nearly horizontal
beds of the plateau region, by narrow unsymmetrical anticlines with
steeper dip on the northwest side, and by broad shallow synclines, to the
complicated folds of the southeast. The axes of these latter folds dip more
or less abruptly northward and southward, causing the ridges to assume
zigzag courses. Synclines are often crossed by anticlines.</p>

<p>Thrust faults exist, some of great magnitude, and traceable for 200 to 300
miles. By the "Rome thrust fault" the Cambrian shales have been shoved
four to five miles over upon the Carboniferous shales. Most of the overthrust
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">« 99 »</a></span>
strata have been worn away, but tongues of Cambrian shale still
remain to all appearances lying conformably upon the Carboniferous strata.
Transverse thrust faults terminate Gaylor's ridge, Dirt Seller Mountain, and
Lookout Mountain on the south.</p>

<p><i>The Correlation of Moraines with Raised Beaches of Lake Erie.</i> By
<span class="smcap">Frank Leverett</span>, U. S. Geol. Surv. (Wisconsin Academy of
Science. Vol. VIII., 1891).</p></div>

<p>References have been made in Geological literature to the beaches of the
eastern portion of the Lake Erie basin, but up to the time of Mr. Leverett's
work none of the beaches had been completely traced. Mr. Gilbert had discovered
that several of the raised beaches do not completely encircle Lake
Erie, and supposed that their eastern termini represent the successive positions
of the front of the continental glacier during its retreat northeastward across
the Lake Erie basin. Mr. Leverett verifies this theory by demonstrating that
certain moraines are the correlatives of the beaches. They are as follows:</p>

<p>I. The Van Wert or upper beach and its correlative moraine, the Blanchard
ridge. II. The Leipsic or second beach and its correlative moraines.
III. The Belmore, or third beach and its correlative moraine.</p>

<p>I. The Van Wert beach extends eastward from the former southwestward
outlet of Lake Erie near Fort Wayne, Indiana, to Findlay, Ohio, where
it joins the Blanchard moraine. Through Indiana and Ohio its altitude is
quite uniformly 210 feet above Lake Erie.</p>

<p>While the Van Wert beach was forming, the ice front was the northeastern
shore of the lake as far east as Findlay, Ohio, its position being marked
by the Blanchard moraine. East of Findlay, where the Van Wert beach
joins it, the moraine is of the normal type. But west of Findlay, it presents
peculiarities of topography and structure, resulting from the presence of
lake water beneath the ice margin. The water was shallow and incapable of
buoying up the ice-sheet, and producing icebergs. The motion of the water
under the ice-sheet produced a variable structure. This is the only
instance of a moraine demonstrably formed in lake water.</p>

<p>II. The Leipsic, or second beach, was formed after the ice had retreated
from its position marked by the Blanchard moraine. Its altitude is 195 to 200
feet above Lake Erie. It has its terminus near Cleveland, where it connects
with the western end of a moraine.</p>

<p>III. The Belmore beach and its correlative moraine. Between the Leipsic
beach and the present shore of Lake Erie are several beaches. One of
these, the Belmore beach, terminates near Cleveland, while the others extend
into southwestern New York, and probably connect with moraines, though
this connection has not been traced. The general altitude of the Belmore
beach in Ohio is 160 to 170 feet above Lake Erie. Unlike the Van Wert and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">« 100 »</a></span>
Leipsic beaches, it does not directly connect with a moraine at its eastern end,
but a gap of ten miles intervenes. Terraces at Cleveland, Mr. Leverett
thinks, make a connection between the eastern end of the beach and the western
end of the moraine at Euclid, Ohio.</p>

<p><i>The Climate of Europe During the Glacial Epoch.</i> By <span class="smcap">Clement Reid</span>.
(Natural Science. Vol. I, No. 6, 1892).</p></div>

<p><i>Temperature of the Sea.</i>&mdash;The temperature of the English Channel was
similar to that where the isotherm of 32° F. is now situated. The winter
temperature can scarcely have been 20° colder than at present. The Mediterranean
was perhaps 5° colder than now.</p>

<p><i>Temperature of the Land (air).</i>&mdash;It does not appear that the climate of
the lowlands of southern Europe can have been 20° lower than the present
mean; 10° or perhaps less appear to have been the refrigeration in the Mediterranean
region. The temperature at the southern margin of the
ice-sheet was about 20° colder than at present. The temperature increased
rapidly towards the south. Recent observations seem to show that throughout
central Europe there was a period of <i>dry</i> cold, causing the country to
resemble the arid regions of central Asia.</p>

<p><i>On the Glacial Period and the Earth-Movement Hypothesis.</i> By <span class="smcap">James
Geikie</span>, Edinburgh, Scotland. (Read before the Victoria Institute,
London).</p></div>

<p>Geologists generally admit that there have been at least two glacial
epochs, separated by one well-marked interglacial period. The closing
stage of the Pleistocene period was one of cold conditions in northwestern
Europe, accompanied by land depressions. After this came a genial
climate with a union of the British islands among themselves and also with
the continent. This was followed by a cold, humid condition.</p>

<p>Upham maintains that the whole of North America north of the Gulf of
Mexico stood at least three thousand feet higher at the beginning of the
glacial epoch than at present. Fiords were formed before glacial times and
so can not be cited as evidence of high land during the glacial period. An
elevation of land in the northern part of North America and Europe could
not produce glaciation in their southern parts. The deflection of the Gulf
Stream by the sinking of the Panama, Professor Geikie argues, could not
produce the conditions which prevailed during the glacial epoch. The
Earth-Movement hypothesis, he believes, accounts neither for the widespread
phenomena of the ice-age, nor for the remarkable interglacial climates.
Some maintain that the warm interglacial period was produced by the rise
of the Panama land, the sinking of the lands to the north, and the turning of
the Gulf Stream from the Pacific into the Atlantic. Why then, asks Professor
Geikie, do we not have such a climate now?</p>

be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
